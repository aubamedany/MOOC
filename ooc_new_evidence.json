      "A suspect has been arrested over the fatal shooting of 10 people including a police officer in a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado. Plus, the US sanctions China over alleged Uighur human rights abuses",
      "WASHINGTON (SBG) — Under intensifying pressure, the Biden administration Tuesday released videos and dozens of photographs from inside holding facilities along the southern border, showing living conditions and the handling of unaccompanied children. Caption: (Video: Sinclair Broadcast Group) While the White House acknowledges a need for improvement, it lays blame on the Trump administration. \"We expect to have success, but it's going to take a lot of work,\" Vice President Kamala Harris said.",
      "At America’s southern border, the concerning trend continues: more apprehensions and more unaccompanied minors. Caption: Video: Sinclair Broadcast Group. These numbers have not been seen in 15 years. United States Customs and Border Protection temporary overflow facility in Donna, Texas. (Photo: Office of Congressman Henry Cuellar) In March, border enforcement officers apprehended roughly 172,000 people, which is a 71% spike over February’s numbers.",
      "It was a cautious performance in which he relied heavily on notes and took no question from Fox News.",
      "The president says the record-low refugee limit he originally stuck by did not 'reflect America's values'.",
      "Images released by a Democratic U.S. representative show settings similar to those that Democrats hammered former President Donald Trump over two years ago, when that administration encountered an increase of migrant apprehensions",
      "Amid an influx of immigrant children arriving at the southern border, new images have surfaced from inside the overcrowded facilities on the U.S. side. The Biden administration on Monday sent officials to Mexico to discuss efforts to stem migration north. Amna Nawaz reports on the reasons behind the problem, which starts much farther south.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday announced it will build yet another influx shelter to handle the growing number of unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, and mitigate the risks of the spread of COVID-19 among the arrivals. Amna Nawaz reports from the southern border.",
      "New photos from an overflow facility in Texas showed crowded conditions for migrants over the weekend.",
      "The increase from 380 to nearly 3,500 has overwhelmed local facilities in Mexico, the UN warns.",
      "Thousands of migrant children were in US border custody in a surge of arrivals to the US-Mexico border.",
      "U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy mildly faulted the Biden administration’s care of the growing numbers of child asylum seekers at the southern border Monday, while accusing Republicans of using the issue to distract from successes in fighting COVID-19 and spurring economic growth."

      "In the wake of the Covid pandemic, bats have once again been unfairly maligned. As the go-to scapegoat of choice for many, some even called for the mammals’ eradication. In Batlove Redux, Tessa Laird, author of the book Bat, part of Reaktion’s much-loved Animal series, mounts an impassioned defense of these marvelous creatures. Laird celebrates bats, recalling art and literature inspired by the mammals, while raising the alarm over their plight amidst a warming planet. She recalls her own heartbreaking experiences volunteering to rescue flying-foxes during forest fires at Yarra Bend Park in Australia.",

      "Titanoboa (name meaning \"Titanic Boa\") is a genus of gargantuan Boidae that originated during the Middle Paleocene epoch in what is now South America. Essentially a large prehistoric snake measuring 15 meters long and weighing over a ton, Titanoboa was the largest snake of all time and evolved immediately following the extinction of the dinosaurs.

      "snoots-and-scales: ainawgsd: Titanoboa Titanoboa is an extinct genus of snakes that is known to have lived in present-day La Guajira in northern Colombia. The giant snake lived during the Middle to Late Paleocene epoch, a 10-million-year period immediately following the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. The only known species is Titanoboa cerrejonensis, the largest snake ever discovered. By comparing the sizes and shapes of its fossilized vertebrae to those of extant snakes, researchers estimated that the largest individuals of T. cerrejonensis found had a total length around 42 feet and weighed about 2,500 pounds. While initially thought to have been an apex predator of the Paleocene ecosystem in which it lived, evidence has pointed to the genus being predominantly piscivorous. Titanoboa’s massive size would have made it difficult to move on land, so the giant snake would probably have spent most of its life in the water, hunting for fish and other aquatic prey.",

Here is the story of that hope amid the oil spill.",

      "The high profile Mauritian lawyer for the captain of Mauritius oil spill ship, the Wakashio, was unexpectedly replaced with lawyers hired by the shipowners and insurers company. He called these 'dark forces' and has raised fresh questions about the strange case of the Wakashio oil spill.",

      "CHICAGO — Surveillance video shows more than 40 shots being fired as at least three gunmen engaged in a shootout at a 7-Eleven near the Loop on Monday night. No injuries were reported in the incident, which played out at 560 West Grenshaw around 10:32 p.m. The store is just west of the Loop, lying between the West Loop and South Loop neighborhoods. <br><br /><br /> <br>Chicago police responded to shots fired at the store after witnesses reported that the occupants of two cars were shooting at each other. Officers who responded to the scene found shell casings inside the store and near the gas pumps. An officer said some of the casings found in the lot came from a rifle. <br><br /><br /> <br>Video provided to CWBChicago reveals that the men near the gas pumps aren’t the only ones who fired shots. A man inside the store opened the door and unloaded a hail of bullets at two of the other gunmen. <br><br /><br /> <br>The man inside the store seemed to notice the SUV arriving. He dashed back to the entrance and quickly opened fire on it from the doorway. Shell casings are seen flying out of his pistol, one after another. Outside, two men from the SUV opened fire on a sedan parked on the other side of the lot. Exactly who fired the first shots is not clear. <br><br /><br /> <br>After the shootout, both vehicles left the area, heading in different directions."

      "Art exhibition at the Manny Cantor Center, 197 East Broadway, New York, NY 10002. OPENING RECEPTION: THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2018 | 6-8PM | Presented by the Manny Cantor Center and the Jewish Art Sal…",
      "“I cannot go anywhere in America without people wanting to share their wartime experiences....The stories and the lessons have emerged from long-forgotten letters home, from reunions of old buddies and outfits, from unpublished diaries and home-published memoirs....As the stories in this album of memories remind us, it truly was an American experience, from the centers of power to the most humble corners of the land.” —Tom Brokaw In this beautiful American family album of stories from the Greatest Generation, the history of life as it was lived during the Depression and World War II comes alive and is preserved in people’s own words. Photographs and time lines also commemorate important dates and events. An Army Air Corps veteran who enlisted in 1941 at age seventeen writes to describe the Bataan Death March. A black nurse tells of her encounter with wartime segregation. Other members of the Greatest Generation describe their war—in such historic episodes as Guadalcanal, the D-Day invasion, the Battle of the Bulge, and Midway—as well as their lives on the home front. Starting with the Depression and Pearl Harbor, moving on through the war years in Europe, in the Pacific, and at home, this unique book preserves a people’s rich historical heritage and the legacy of a nation’s heroism in war and its courage in peace—in the shaping of their lives and of the world we have today.",
      "What Was the Holocaust? By: Gail Herman Paperback 32 pages 2018 Product Dimensions: 5.3 x 0.3 x 7.7 inches Age Range: 8 - 12 years Grade Level: 3 - 7 The Holocaust was a genocide on a scale never before seen, with as many as twelve million people killed in Nazi death camps—six million of them Jews. Gail Herman traces the rise of Hitler and the Nazis, whose rabid anti-Semitism led first to humiliating anti-Jewish laws, then to ghettos all over Eastern Europe, and ultimately to the Final Solution. She presents just enough information for an elementary-school audience in a readable, well-researched book that covers one of the most horrible times in history. This entry in the New York Times best-selling series contains eighty carefully chosen illustrations and sixteen pages of black and white photographs suitable for young readers.",
      "Brilliant and wrenching, The Holocaust: History and Memory tells the story of the brutal mass slaughter of Jews during World War II and how that genocide has been remembered and misremembered ever since. Taking issue with generations of scholars who separate the Holocaust from Germany's military ambitions, historian Jeremy M. Black demonstrates persuasively that Germany's war on the Allies was entwined with Hitler's war on Jews.",
      "Amid the disturbing surge in antisemitic and other hate-motivated incidents in Canada, FSWC plays a pivotal role in collaborating with law enforcement agencies nationwide.",
      "John Morrow’s The Great War presents a comprehensive analysis of World War I, examining its causes, battles, and global impact. This book offers a thorough and accessible account of the conflict, making it a must-read for history buffs and military scholars alike.",

      "Writing history is as important as making history. If the writer does not remain faithful to what he does, the unchanging truth becomes a state of wonder to mankind... M.KEMAL ATATURK (1931)",
      "By popular demand, we bring you 65 more pictures of vintage nurses being awesome! Nurses throughout the ages from all over the world doing what they do best. Caring for the ill and the wounded, using vintage medical techniques, traveling over oceans, air, mountains, and through enemy fire to get to their patients. And sometimes… just having fun. […]",
      "Between 1861 and 1865, approximately 640 women from twenty-one different religious communities volunteered their nursing services. They asked little remuneration beyond necessities.",
      "With the American Civil War, women began to study medicine and practice the profession of nursing, which was seen as unique to men.",
      "Although women were never officially employed as nurses during the American Civil War, roughly 4,000 worked as volunteers on both sides--both Union and Confederate. Of this number, nearly one-fifth were Catholic nuns who took on the role of battlefield nurse. The Nuns of the Battlefield memorial in Washington D.C. was constructed in 1924 to honor the role of these women in caring for the wounded of America's bloodiest conflict at a time when medicine was often brutal, misinformed, and unsanitary. Conceived and executed by Irish sculptor Jerome Connor, the monument is significant for being only one of two in the area to honor women for their roles in battle.",
      "When a convent of nuns suffered horrific brutalities during World War II, a young woman doctor brought comfort and help.",

      "@askmeknowledgee on Instagram: \"The greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother is 69, to the wife of Feodor Vassilyev (b. 1707–c.1782), a peasant from Shuya, Russia. In 27 confinements she gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets. The case was reported to Moscow by the Monastery of Nikolsk on 27 Feb 1782, which had recorded every birth. It is noted that, by this time, only two of the children who were born in the period c. 1725–65 failed to survive their infancy. . By his first wife: . 4 x 4 = 16 and 7 x 3 = 21 and 16 x 2 = 32 ---------- 27 births 69 children . By his second wife: . 6 x 2 = 12 and 2 x 3 = 6 --------- 8 births 18 children Although this historic record for the most kids by one woman should be taken with a pinch of salt, it is certainly conceivable that Mrs Vassilyev could have had a genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate (release multiple eggs in one cycle), which significantly increases the chance of having twins or multiple children.

In 27 confinements she gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets. The case was reported to Moscow by the Monastery of Nikolsk on 27 Feb 1782, which had recorded every birth. It is noted that, by this time, only two of the children who were born in the period c. 1725–65 failed to survive their infancy. . By his first wife: . 4 x 4 = 16 and 7 x 3 = 21 and 16 x 2 = 32 ---------- 27 births 69 children . By his second wife: . 6 x 2 = 12 and 2 x 3 = 6 --------- 8 births 18 children Although this historic record for the most kids by one woman should be taken with a pinch of salt, it is certainly conceivable that Mrs Vassilyev could have had a genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate (release multiple eggs in one cycle), which significantly increases the chance of having twins or multiple children.

      "Nietzsche’s Ideal Implodes\nSalaquarda points out that “Historical criticism remained Nietzsche’s most important argument against religion up to the beginning of the 1880s.”[1] However, there are many persuasive arguments that have been made that support, for instance, the resurrection of the Jesus.[2] So, in my opinion, a convincing case can be made for why we can and should believe in the resurrection of Jesus and for the reliability of the Old and New Testaments. Thus, the bedrock of Nietzsche’s criticism is unfounded. In the end, it is his foundation that is shaky (Nietzsche does not even believe in true truth!). Nietzsche also claimed that God was dead and told people that they should live in light of that reality. However, good arguments can be made that conclude that God is alive and well.[3] Truly, even as we look at the world we live in it seems apparent that it is the fool that says there is no God (Ps. 14:1; 53:1).\nNietzsche said, “atheism and a sort of second innocence belong together.”[4] If God is dead there is not only no morality, there is innocence. No one is guilty. No one should feel guilty. Each person can freely do what they see as right in their own eyes. However, human experience tells us otherwise. Nietzsche seems to paint hell as heaven. If we apply his logic he seems to hold up the carnage of Auschwitz as a return to Eden.[5] As William Lane Craig has said, “If God does not exist, then in a sense, our world is Auschwitz: there is no right and wrong; all things are permitted.”[6]\nThe world will eventually burn up in the death of the sun. There is no meaning. We are decaying matter that will soon be planted. If we are merely matter in motion then we have no morals. We cannot say man descended from apes and thus has no final importance and also say that we must love one another. That reasoning does not follow.\nIf there is no transcultural and transtemporal truth or meaning and we are all just the products of Darwinian chance then it follows that human dignity and morality has no ultimate grounding. If it is the case that our most fundamental urge is to survive, even if it literally means that the strong will eat the weak, then that is fine. Each should do what is right in their own eyes. However, as we will see, Nietzsche is deceived and his doctrine brings nothing, nothing but death, despair, and cruelty. What Nietzsche said about nihilism is very ironic considering it is his philosophy that actually, in the final analysis, leads to nihilism. If we kill God, we necessarily kill our conscience too (Cf. e.g. Rom. 1) and all manner of chaos and curse ensue. Nietzsche believed he was anti-nihilistic and thus believed he should be anti-Christian and anti-compassion, but he was really anti-life and anti-flourishing. However, Nietzsche’s ideal implodes for a lot of reasons.\nWhat Nietzsche and sadly many others do not see is that this “freedom” is man being given up to their own devices. We need God. We need morality. What we sow we reap. What we work for is what we get paid. The punishment of sin seems to be intrinsic, affixed within its very nature.\nWhat is very interesting is that Nietzsche did have a sort of moral code. Nietzsche, for example, criticizes Christianity but holds up his maxims of what we should live for as right. So, “Nietzsche did have an explicit moral ontology, even if it was not conventional.”[7] As Roger Scruton has said,\nNietzsche… argues that there are no truths, only interpretations. But you need only ask yourself whether what Nietzsche says is true, to realise [sic] how paradoxical it is. (If it is true, then it is false! – an instance of the so-called ‘liar’ paradox.)… A writer who says that there are no truths, or that all truth is ‘merely relative’, is asking you not to believe him.[8]\nNietzsche was committed to a set of values[9] and he says that Christianity is actually nihilism. Christianity for Nietzsche led essentially to nonbeing, to the denial of the will to power, the will to life. It’s clear from reading Nietzsche that he thought that there are some forms of morality that are better than others. However, the sense of morality that Nietzsche seems to be supporting is the morality of an animal bent on survival at all costs.\nNietzsche says, “In the whole New Testament, there appears but a solitary figure worthy of honour… Pilate.” And the only saying that has any value in the New Testament to Nietzsche “is at once its criticism and its destruction: ‘What is truth?…’”[10] So, what can we do with a philosophy that claims that there is no objective truth? We can deconstruct it and show the position’s absurd conclusions.[11]\nNietzsche believed that since “God is dead” there is no morality. Yet, Nietzsche said, “All religions are, at their most fundamental, systems of cruelty.”[12] However, on what basis can Nietzsche call something “cruel”? Truly, as Francis A. Schaeffer said, “It is impossible for any non-Christian individual or group to be consistent to their  system in logic or in practice.”[13] Or, as Craig has said, “If God does not exist, then life is objectively meaningless; but man cannot live consistently and happily knowing that life is meaningless; so in order to be happy he pretends that life has meaning.”[14]\nGreg L. Bahnsen has rightly pointed out that\n\nThe very denial of the possibility of knowledge transcending experience is in itself a metaphysical judgment. Thus the question is not whether one should have metaphysical beliefs, but it comes down to the question of which kind of metaphysic one should affirm.[15]\n\nNietzsche kills our rational, saying God is dead because we killed him, and then (irrationally) says we must live. However, why?! And to what end? Nietzsche cuts us down at the knees and tells us to run on with full vigor. However, we cannot. We have no meaning and no direction so how should we use our will? Further, whose will? We contradict each other. So, we are left with warring wills. Mine against yours and yours against mine.\nOf course, there are many other inconsistencies that we could look at, including Nietzsche’s lack of argument for his conclusions in On the Genealogy of Morality or the various “straw men” that he erects.[16] “Nietzsche’s criticism… has neither actually done away with Christianity nor worked out a logically irresistible refutation.”[17] There are many points that we could make against Nietzsche and his thought but the main thing we can acknowledge at this point is that his ideal implodes, his philosophy is unfounded.\n_______________\n[1] Salaquarda, “Nietzsche and the Judaeo-Christian tradition,” 99.

      "<p>REPUBLICA.CO.ID, By: <em><strong>Fuji Pratiwi</strong> The seeds of radicalism grow with government repressiveness <br /><br />.</em> <br /><br />For a country with a land area of 2.7 million square kilometers, Kazakhstan's population of 17 million in 2012 is probably small. <br /><br />So, not surprisingly, with natural wealth in the form of potential coal, gold, and petroleum mines, Kazakhs are relatively prosperous. <br /><br />Islam entered Kazakhstan in the 8th century. The teachings of Islam seem to be relatively easy to accept by the various ethnicities that were at that time nomadic. <br /><br /><em>Like the former Soviet colonies, anti-religious policies that lasted from 1920 to 1991 caused Islam to grow slowly in those days, Rosemary Pennington writes in her article, The Islamic Renaissance of Kazakhstan.</em> <br /><br />After independence, Kazakh Muslims who became the majority could more freely show their identity. Nevertheless, it took more effort to introduce Kazakhstan's younger generation of Islam to its religion. <br /><br />Therefore, Kazakh Islamic youth are only beginning to fulfill their obligations as Muslims between the ages of 15 and 20. Not because they didn't realize they were Muslim, but because of a lack of knowledge. <br /><br />The vast region is home to a number of Islamist-leaning ethnicities other than Kazakhs, such as Uzbeks, Uighurs, Tatars, Kirghiz, Bashkir, Tajik, Azerbaijanis, Dungan, Turk, Chechens, and Ingush. The majority are Sunni Muslims. <br /><br />In <em>the article The Islamic Situation in Kazakhstan</em> on <em>The Daily Journalist,</em> Al-Farabi Kazakh National University academic Saniya Edelbay writes that the number of mosques</p> in Kazakhstan is growing. <p>During Soviet rule until 1991, there were only 63, now it has reached about 2,500 mosques. <br /><br /></p>",
      "City of Apples. Almaty literally means “city of apple trees” or “City of Apples”. The largest mosque in Kazakhstan and is the main mosque in the country.",

      "<p>REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, Moscow--There is no mistaking the opinion that the Muslim population is growing rapidly. US researcher and historian Daniel Pipes confirms this. <br /><br />Today, the average citizen of Russia and Europe has 1.4 children. In Moscow, the average Russian family has 1.1 children. Among Muslims, an average of 2.3 children with a very small abortion rate, he said as reported by Panarmenian.net on Tuesday (22/10). <br /><br />According to Pipes, in addition to the birth rate, the increase in the Muslim population is also due to the arrival of immigrants from states of the former Soviet Union such as Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. The trend saw the Christian population drop 0.6 percent a year, while Muslims were increasing by the same percentage, he said. <br /><br />Some analysts expect Muslims to become the majority in Russia in the 21st century—a demographic revolution that will fundamentally change the character of the country. The Muslim community is starting to take pride in using the term Russian Muslim, and you know half of Russia's conscript soldiers are from among Muslims, he said. <br /><br />However, Pipes said, Russian Muslims like those in Britain and Sweden would face a worse anti-Islamic situation. This is the homework of Muslims in Russia.</p>",

      "<p>REPUBLICA.CO.ID, By: <strong>Fuji Pratiwi</strong> The seeds of radicalism grow with government repressiveness <br /> <br /><em>. <br /></em><br />Children and young people can also freely go to the mosque. Women who use veils are also commonly seen in various places. Madrasahs, academies, and institutes that teach Islam have also sprung up. <br /><br />In 1997, the monthly tabloid Islam Elemi (Islam World) and the newspaper Nur Shapagat began publishing as Islamic media. Hajj worship is also becoming more widely known and the Quran reading contest has also emerged as a reaffirmation of Islamic values. <br /><br />Since independence in 1991, Kazakh authorities have not banned the display of Islamic values in cultural activities, such as the celebration of the birth and naming of babies or circumcision accompanied by the recitation of Quranic verses. <br /><br />But, Islamic political entities are expressly banned by the government. It is not surprising, then, that the seeds of a movement considered radical are growing and being overseen by the government. <br /><br />According to Maral Tazhibaeva in the article <em>What Does the Future Hold for</em> Islam in Kazakhstan? At <em>centralasiaonline.com,</em> the potential for radical movements could also be greater if more religious people do not know their religion as a result of being under the compulsion to atheism for too long. <br /><br />Saniya Edelbay in her article <em>Traditional Kazakh Culture and Islam</em> wrote some activities of Kazakh society influenced by Islamic values. The activity was, among other things, the first, the pilgrimage and the procession of the body handling. <br /><br />Kazakh society generally made pilgrimages to the tombs of scholars. If a family member dies, in addition to the Islamic management of the body, there is also a teaching to pray for the deceased several times on every Thursday or Friday. <br /><br />Secondly, the birth of a child and circumcision. Many series of events go through when a family has a baby, from the removal of the umbilical cord, the naming at 40 days after birth. <br /><br /><br /></p>",

      "<p>REPUBLICA.CO.ID, By: <strong>Fuji Pratiwi</strong> The seeds of radicalism grow with government repressiveness <br /> <br /><em>. <br /></em><br />At the procession of circumcision, there is a ritual of riding a horse for the first time, until the event of akil baligh</p> at the age of 13. <p>In each of its activities, a mullah (religious figure) is always involved to lead the reading of the Quran and prayers. The Dhuafa are also usually invited to take part in the joy of these celebrations. <br /><br />Third, marriage. Kazakh society has several stages before marrying their children, ranging from matchmaking, wedding events, and postnuptial events. <br /><br />On the wedding day of Muslim couples, there is usually a neke kiju event. A mullah would pray for brides and give them a drink of the water they had prayed for. <br /><br />Some coins are then dipped in the remaining drinking water which is then distributed to the guests. Guests are welcome to take the coins to give to children as part of sharing happiness. <br /><br />Fourth, the celebration of spring. During the reign of the Soviet Union, this annual ritual, also called Nowryz, was made a national holiday. However, the event is actually rooted in Persian culture. The celebration is held every 21 to 23 March. <br /><br />Today is a day of family gathering and re-purifying the soul of the body. The special meal consisting of seven spices or Nowryz koje is only served on this day as a token of gratitude for the abundant produce. <br /><br />This food is not only eaten by one family, but also distributed to the poor. Although not part of Islamic celebrations, Nowryz persists in Kazakhstan because it is considered not to contradict Islamic values. <br /><br /><br /></p>",

      "Moscow—Islam is the second most widely professed religion in Russia after Orthodox Christianity. The number is about 21-28 million inhabitants or 15-20 percent of the approximately 142 million inhabitants. Islam is considered one of the traditional religions that are the historical heritage of Russia. According to a poll by the Russian Center for Public Opinion Research, six percent of respondents consider themselves Muslim."

Meanwhile, Romanian historiography was constantly preoccupied with the question of Hungarian sovereignty in northern Transylvania. In Romanian historiography, however, little attention has been paid to the social movements of the period, the refugee question, the living conditions of the almost one million Romanians living in Transylvania, questions of propaganda, the intentions of the great powers or the real nature of Hungarian-Romanian relations. In the last ten years, research has been launched in Hungarian historiography that seeks to explore the history of these four years, applying new approaches, processing documents and other sources from Romanian and Hungarian archives. This book is the first attempt to find an explanation, free from previous fixations, on published and unpublished research, as well as on a large number of documents found in Hungarian archives: how Hungary's Northern Transylvania became again, how the Hungarian government tried to transform it into a Hungarian national space, to keep it, and finally how it was lost again.",
      "Hungary regained about 43,000 square kilometers from Transylvania, of which 54 percent, or 1.3 million people, declared themselves Hungarian, according to the 1941 census, of the 2.4 million population.",

      "Former U.S. Attorney-General, Robert Kennedy visits the Rebbe at Chabad Headquarters. (1964)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll News\n\n\n \n\n\nBy Samuel Kaplan , Brooklyn, NY \n\nMarch 24, 2021 \n\n\n 11 Nissan, corresponding this year to Wednesday, March 24, 2021, marks the birth date of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, who was born in 1902. Jewish communities worldwide will be honoring the day with activities that celebrate the Rebbe’s legacy of Jewish education, Jewish pride and Jewish unity.\n27 years after the Rebbe’s passing, his extraordinary life continues to inspire writers and academics to explore his life and the dramatic movement he led to revive Jewish life.\nIn 1964, Samuel Kaplan, the publisher and editor of the Jewish Western Bulletin of Vancouver, Canada, wrote an editorial following a private audience he had with the Lubavitcher Rebbe. The following, from the archives of Chabad-Lubavitch Headquarters, is a draft dated November 18 1964, that the editor submitted to the Rebbe’s secretariat for perusal prior to publication.\n\nThe World of Lubavitch\nThe streamlined jet-age conveyance had flown the writer to New York; and vintage limousine had completed the journey to Brooklyn. Yet upon reaching the entrance of the building which houses the office of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, it seemed that occurrences of another era were happening again.\nThere were at least a few distressing similarities between the anti-Jewish violence of peasants in the villages of Czarist Russia and contemporary pogrom-like activities of hoodlums in the largest U.S. metropolis.\nIt is possible that a visitor seeking an audience with one of the earlier Lubavitcher Rabbis in Russia or Poland, and knowing that the police would not lift a hand to assist a Jewish victim, would have felt a sense of apprehension. Similarly in America today, a visitor to the Lubavitch area knows that even policemen of the Brooklyn species have grudgingly admitted their inability to cope with the violent situations that exist on many of the streets and alleyways of the crowded Bedford-Stuyvesant sector of the city.\nHowever, as the taxi sped that recent night to the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, the recollection that a group of persons known as the “Maccabees” had helped restore law and order to the area, afforded a feeling of confidence and pride. The young Chassidic Jews, led by their commander, Rabbi Samuel Schrage and aided by Episcopalians and even Negroes, were at that very moment patrolling the area with two-way radio transmitters, alerting police authorities of suspicious movements, would-be burglars, rapists and knifers, before violence occurred.\nThe “Macabee” patrols represent, in fact, a 20th century self-defence movement that is not unrelated to the many Jewish survival programs undertaken by Lubavitoher leaders of bygone days and in distant lands. For facing desperate situations as they fought to survive against poverty and hostility was the common inheritance of predecessors of the dynasty that was founded by Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov (1698-1760) and formalized by Rabbi Schneur Zalman (1745-1812). It was in honor of the latter that each succeeding Lubavitcher Rabbi has added “Schneerson” to his name.\nThe immediate predecessor of the present Lubavitcher Rabbi, the late Rabbi Joseph Isaac Schneerson, was at the forefront in the fight against the anti-religious organization known as the “Yevsektzia” and the secret “Tchekau. Fearless in his struggle against the forces of anti-Semitism, he was arrested no less than four times by the Czar’s police in Moscow and St. Petersburg. When he landed in New York in 1940, he had just lived through the German bombardment of Warsaw and previously had been liberated from solitary confinement and a Communist-imposed death sentence in a Leningrad prison, the liberation on being due in part to the intervention of the late President Hoover. When he set foot for the first time on U.S. soil, the Lubavitcher Rabbi was granted the freedom of the City of New York and later was received at the White House by President Hoover.\nNow, as we approached the Eastern Parkway building in Brooklyn, the opportunity would soon arrive to learn at first hand about the present Lubavitcher Rabbi’s role as head of a Chassidic movement whose followers are numbered in the hundreds of thousands and whose institutions of education and worship are to be found in the far corners of the earth.\nThe interview had been set for eleven o’clock on Thursday evening, comparatively an early hour since Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson customarily receives most of his visitors during hours well past midnight, thrice weekly. The distinguished Torah scholar’s work day lasts 15 or 16 hours.\nThe moment of arrival at Lubavitcher headquarters contrasted with the violent night mood of the city and cut through the cold darkness. For waiting at the curb to extend their hands in warm welcome with the traditional greeting of “Peace” were several young be arded Chassidim, some with traditional side curls, wide-brimmed hats and flowing black coats. First to say “Shalom Aleichem” was Rabbi Label Groner, the Rabbi’s secretary to whom the writer had spoken on the telephone. Following customary introductions, we proceeded to the office of Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, a youthful disciple who, in addition to continuing his studies and other duties, is in charge of public relations as well as preparing publicity material for news media.\nAs we awaited our meeting with the “Rebbe”, as he is affectionately called by his disciples, we learned from Rabbi Krinsky that many distinguished persons are regularly received by the Rebbec. Only a few days before, the former U.S. Attorney-General, Robert Kennedy, had visited him, and Senator Kenneth Keating had indicated that he would be doing likewise.\nRabbi Krinsky hastened to add that the Rebbe always took a neutral position not only in general political matters but also concerning political issues within the Jewish community, in order to enable persons of every persuasion to approach him for guidance and seek personal acquaintance with him. It permits him, as well, to seek the widest possible support for his vast program of Jewish education including numerous schools and Yeshivot in many parts of the world.\nAnd as if to underline the movement’s magnitude, Rabbi Krinsky’s phone rang constantly, many of the calls originating in distant cities and far-off countries. Because of time zone differences, telephones at Lubavitcher headquarters are manned twenty-four hours a day.\nFinally Rabbi Krinsky placed the phone back on the receiver and in a moment, the writer was ushered into the study of the world leader of the Lubavitcher movement.\nRabbi Schneerson was seated at his desk, a man in his early sixties, eyes bright and warm, bespeaking a gentle soul and a wisdom nurtured by a tradition ancient and rich. Graciously he beckoned to a nearby chair and listened with wrapt attention as we told him about ourselves and the Jewish community of Vancouver.\nWe conversed mainly in Yiddish but he evinced an excellent command of the English tongue.\nThe Rabbi consented to answer some formal questions which we had prepared.\nThe first, related to the Catholic Ecumenical Council, asked for the Rabbi’s opinion on the effect which might be expected should the Council pass the original “schema” concerning the Jews.\nThe Rabbi asked for a clarification as to which of the original” schema we referred, since he stated there had been a total of three. The first, he pointed out, while it had been the basis for much comment and speculation, had never been made fully public.\nThen he addressed himself to the main issue. In his view: if the Council passes a resolution that will help to remove the basis of anti-Semitism, then it is most desirable; the elimination of anti-Semitism is the urgent concern of all Jews and the passing of a schema might help to bring this about. “It therefore has a practical application to Jews,” he declared. “If Jews are being persecuted all of us must be concerned and we ought to voice our urgent concern in this matter.”\nRabbi Schneerson emphasized that he was not looking at it from the theological aspect but rather from the general and historic. He noted as an example that if during the terrible age of the Crusades the means could have been found to get the Christians to alter the dogma which was the basis of a violent anti-Semitism that cost the lives of 400,000 Jews, some or all of those lives might have been saved. As his final comment, the Rabbi stressed the need for guarded optimism in the matter, pointing out that even the latest schema may be tabled at this session of the Council.\nOur next question concerned itself with the future of the Jewish community of North America. Aware that the first Lubavitcher Rabbi to come to this continent had adopted as his goal the objective of establishing a Torah centre to take the place of\nthe devastated communities of Europe, and knowing that the present Rabbi had also expended the greatest efforts on behalf of “Torah-true” Judaism, we asked him to predict the state of Jewish communal life 50 years from now, particularly with regard to balances of observant and non-observant Jews and the state of Jewish education.\nThe Rabbi replied that it was not necessary to attempt to forecast as far ahead as 50 years. He said it was possible to predict with certainty a general movement towards the Right in Judaism: since the trend during the past decade had been for\nConservative Judaism to become more Orthodox, and Reform more Conservative, there was every likelihood of this trend continuing for the next decade. He cited the growth of Jewish Day schools as one manifestation of this trend, wherein Conservative congregations who were formerly opposed to such schools are now sponsoring their own, and the Reform, who were even less inclined to think about Day schools, are now starting to talk about them.\nIncidentall y, we had learned earlier that the Lubavitcher movement operates the Merkos L’Inyonei Chinuch ( Central Organization for Jewish Education), a vast network of Day schools and yeshivot with an enrollment in the tens of thousands, located in lands as far distant as Australia, Brazil and North Africa. This does not include its vocational schools, youth clubs and summer camps which provide informal Jewish education to countless others.\nSince the interview by this time had stretched considerably longer than the customary quarter-hour duration, we indicated that our questions had ended. But before we had begun to express our appreciation, the Rabbi stated that he, too, had a question to ask. As it turned out, his question was directed not to the writer alone but rather to all Vancouver Jewry.\nFirstly, he stressed the great responsibility History has rested on the shoulders of every living Jewish man, woman and child as a result of the death of six millions of our people during the Second World War. Had tragedy not claimed them, he said, would they not now be making a creative contribution to our people and to all mankind? Is it not, therefore, the sacred duty of every surviving Jew to do more than would normally have been expected of him, to compensate for such a loss?\nRegrettably, the Rabbi stated, there are assimilationist Jews who place no value in Judaism and who deny their children a Jewish education. These people, by hastening their own Jewish demise, are fulfilling the plan for the “Final Solution” begun by the Nazis.\nMore than a question, it was in our opinion, a challenge to every Jewish person in our community.\nAnd the answer, he said, is for Jews to rededicate themselves to furthering Jewish education, to give their lives new meaning by turning to the spiritual substance that is the inheritance of every Jew and as such has always been their right: Torah, the Shulchan Aruch (Code of Laws) and observances of the Mitzvot (Commandments).\nAs we emerged from the audience we were surrounded by some dozen young disciples excitedly asking, “Vos hot der Rebbe gezokt?” -What did the Rabbi say?\nWithin the hour, the young Chassidim held open the doors of the building and guarded their Rebbe as he entered his car and was driven away into the night.;Former U.S. Attorney-General, Robert Kennedy visits the Rebbe at Chabad Headquarters. (1964)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll News\n\n\n \n\n\nBy Samuel Kaplan , Brooklyn, NY \n\nMarch 24, 2021 \n\n\n 11 Nissan, corresponding this year to Wednesday, March 24, 2021, marks the birth date of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M.

When he landed in New York in 1940, he had just lived through the German bombardment of Warsaw and previously had been liberated from solitary confinement and a Communist-imposed death sentence in a Leningrad prison, the liberation on being due in part to the intervention of the late President Hoover. When he set foot for the first time on U.S. soil, the Lubavitcher Rabbi was granted the freedom of the City of New York and later was received at the White House by President Hoover.\nNow, as we approached the Eastern Parkway building in Brooklyn, the opportunity would soon arrive to learn at first hand about the present Lubavitcher Rabbi’s role as head of a Chassidic movement whose followers are numbered in the hundreds of thousands and whose institutions of education and worship are to be found in the far corners of the earth.\nThe interview had been set for eleven o’clock on Thursday evening, comparatively an early hour since Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson customarily receives most of his visitors during hours well past midnight, thrice weekly. The distinguished Torah scholar’s work day lasts 15 or 16 hours.\nThe moment of arrival at Lubavitcher headquarters contrasted with the violent night mood of the city and cut through the cold darkness. For waiting at the curb to extend their hands in warm welcome with the traditional greeting of “Peace” were several young be arded Chassidim, some with traditional side curls, wide-brimmed hats and flowing black coats. First to say “Shalom Aleichem” was Rabbi Label Groner, the Rabbi’s secretary to whom the writer had spoken on the telephone. Following customary introductions, we proceeded to the office of Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, a youthful disciple who, in addition to continuing his studies and other duties, is in charge of public relations as well as preparing publicity material for news media.\nAs we awaited our meeting with the “Rebbe”, as he is affectionately called by his disciples, we learned from Rabbi Krinsky that many distinguished persons are regularly received by the Rebbec. Only a few days before, the former U.S. Attorney-General, Robert Kennedy, had visited him, and Senator Kenneth Keating had indicated that he would be doing likewise.\nRabbi Krinsky hastened to add that the Rebbe always took a neutral position not only in general political matters but also concerning political issues within the Jewish community, in order to enable persons of every persuasion to approach him for guidance and seek personal acquaintance with him. It permits him, as well, to seek the widest possible support for his vast program of Jewish education including numerous schools and Yeshivot in many parts of the world.\nAnd as if to underline the movement’s magnitude, Rabbi Krinsky’s phone rang constantly, many of the calls originating in distant cities and far-off countries. Because of time zone differences, telephones at Lubavitcher headquarters are manned twenty-four hours a day.\nFinally Rabbi Krinsky placed the phone back on the receiver and in a moment, the writer was ushered into the study of the world leader of the Lubavitcher movement.\nRabbi Schneerson was seated at his desk, a man in his early sixties, eyes bright and warm, bespeaking a gentle soul and a wisdom nurtured by a tradition ancient and rich. Graciously he beckoned to a nearby chair and listened with wrapt attention as we told him about ourselves and the Jewish community of Vancouver.\nWe conversed mainly in Yiddish but he evinced an excellent command of the English tongue.\nThe Rabbi consented to answer some formal questions which we had prepared.\nThe first, related to the Catholic Ecumenical Council, asked for the Rabbi’s opinion on the effect which might be expected should the Council pass the original “schema” concerning the Jews.\nThe Rabbi asked for a clarification as to which of the original” schema we referred, since he stated there had been a total of three. The first, he pointed out, while it had been the basis for much comment and speculation, had never been made fully public.\nThen he addressed himself to the main issue. In his view: if the Council passes a resolution that will help to remove the basis of anti-Semitism, then it is most desirable; the elimination of anti-Semitism is the urgent concern of all Jews and the passing of a schema might help to bring this about. “It therefore has a practical application to Jews,” he declared. “If Jews are being persecuted all of us must be concerned and we ought to voice our urgent concern in this matter.”\nRabbi Schneerson emphasized that he was not looking at it from the theological aspect but rather from the general and historic. He noted as an example that if during the terrible age of the Crusades the means could have been found to get the Christians to alter the dogma which was the basis of a violent anti-Semitism that cost the lives of 400,000 Jews, some or all of those lives might have been saved. As his final comment, the Rabbi stressed the need for guarded optimism in the matter, pointing out that even the latest schema may be tabled at this session of the Council.\nOur next question concerned itself with the future of the Jewish community of North America. Aware that the first Lubavitcher Rabbi to come to this continent had adopted as his goal the objective of establishing a Torah centre to take the place of\nthe devastated communities of Europe, and knowing that the present Rabbi had also expended the greatest efforts on behalf of “Torah-true” Judaism, we asked him to predict the state of Jewish communal life 50 years from now, particularly with regard to balances of observant and non-observant Jews and the state of Jewish education.\nThe Rabbi replied that it was not necessary to attempt to forecast as far ahead as 50 years. He said it was possible to predict with certainty a general movement towards the Right in Judaism: since the trend during the past decade had been for\nConservative Judaism to become more Orthodox, and Reform more Conservative, there was every likelihood of this trend continuing for the next decade. He cited the growth of Jewish Day schools as one manifestation of this trend, wherein Conservative congregations who were formerly opposed to such schools are now sponsoring their own, and the Reform, who were even less inclined to think about Day schools, are now starting to talk about them.\nIncidentall y, we had learned earlier that the Lubavitcher movement operates the Merkos L’Inyonei Chinuch ( Central Organization for Jewish Education), a vast network of Day schools and yeshivot with an enrollment in the tens of thousands, located in lands as far distant as Australia, Brazil and North Africa. This does not include its vocational schools, youth clubs and summer camps which provide informal Jewish education to countless others.\nSince the interview by this time had stretched considerably longer than the customary quarter-hour duration, we indicated that our questions had ended. But before we had begun to express our appreciation, the Rabbi stated that he, too, had a question to ask. As it turned out, his question was directed not to the writer alone but rather to all Vancouver Jewry.\nFirstly, he stressed the great responsibility History has rested on the shoulders of every living Jewish man, woman and child as a result of the death of six millions of our people during the Second World War. Had tragedy not claimed them, he said, would they not now be making a creative contribution to our people and to all mankind? Is it not, therefore, the sacred duty of every surviving Jew to do more than would normally have been expected of him, to compensate for such a loss?\nRegrettably, the Rabbi stated, there are assimilationist Jews who place no value in Judaism and who deny their children a Jewish education. These people, by hastening their own Jewish demise, are fulfilling the plan for the “Final Solution” begun by the Nazis.\nMore than a question, it was in our opinion, a challenge to every Jewish person in our community.\nAnd the answer, he said, is for Jews to rededicate themselves to furthering Jewish education, to give their lives new meaning by turning to the spiritual substance that is the inheritance of every Jew and as such has always been their right: Torah, the Shulchan Aruch (Code of Laws) and observances of the Mitzvot (Commandments).\nAs we emerged from the audience we were surrounded by some dozen young disciples excitedly asking, “Vos hot der Rebbe gezokt?” -What did the Rabbi say?\nWithin the hour, the young Chassidim held open the doors of the building and guarded their Rebbe as he entered his car and was driven away into the night."

      "The organizers of Wacken 2023 recently announced a new wave of bands. Including two fan favorites.",
      "Wacken Open Air is one of the biggest and most famous music festivals in the world. Every year, it brings together more than 75,000 people from all over the world to enjoy the best metal music and an unforgettable atmosphere. The festival takes place in the small town of Wacken in Germany, which over the course of several days has become a real capital of world metal culture.",

      "Thank you metalheads for making Wacken Open Air 2022 unforgettable",
      "We are back from the 31st edition of the famous WACKEN OPEN AIR, and here we leave you our experiences and impressions of this “rare” year",
      "Many people have heard about the so-called open air, but not everyone understands the true essence of this event format. Open-air organization is also an art that requires a responsible approach and consideration of many details. When planning such events, there are simply no trifles: literally every nuance can affect the result. Why is the open air style so popular? First of all, people are attracted to the very concept of the event. Open air is often a large-scale open-air party, surrounded by picturesque landscapes or near a pond.",

A paramedic snaps a photo of the tender scene. His coworker, a close friend of the doctor, posts the photo (with permission) online.Minutes after the photograph, the doctor returns to work “holding his head high.”\n\n\nThousands of people have commented on the web. In their own words, here is why the photo went viral:\n\n\n1) Humans crave raw empathy. The photographer captures a poignant moment in a stoic profession that trains doctors to remain professionally distant. The voyeuristic photo reveals the emotional reality of doctoring—and a side of physicians that people don’t usually see—while uniting us all in our common humanity.\n\n\n2) Unexpected death is universally heartbreaking. An ER doc, Smeee, writes:\n\n\nWhen it comes to our work, nothing is harder—and I mean nothing—than telling a loved one that their family member is dead. Give me a bloody airway to intubate. Give me the heroin addict who needed IV access yesterday, but no one can get an IV. Give me the child with anaphylaxis. But don’t give me the unexpected death. . . . We can only do so much, and we can only hope to do our best. But it’s that moment, when you stop resuscitation, and you look around, you look down at your shoes to make sure there’s no blood on them before talking with family, you put your coat back on and you take a deep breath, because you know that you have to tell a family that literally the worst thing imaginable has happened. And it’s in that moment that I feel. And I feel like the guy in this picture.\n\n\n\n3) Doctors are not allowed to grieve. A surgeon, TheGreatGator, shares, “We are never formally trained to deal with loss and/or with giving the worst news of a families life to them.” Another doctor, boldwhite, writes:\n\n\nI know what that person is feeling. Yesterday one of my 17-month-old patients died. I was in the bathroom crying in private between patients several times yesterday. I’ve cried in stairwells and hallways. It eats at you. Life is very fragile and the pain of losing those we are trying to help becomes a scar that doesn’t go away. It has shaped who I am as a person.\n\n\n\n4) In medicine, crying is unprofessional. That needs to change—now. A premedical student volunteering in the local ER tells me about a female physician who cried after losing a child. He thought her behavior was unprofessional. I asked him to consider, “Who did she harm by crying?” Meanwhile, a physician tells me she’s been cited for unprofessional conduct for crying at work. Her boss told her, “Unless you are dying, crying is unprofessional behavior and not to be tolerated.” Some physicians and young doctors-in-training are uncomfortable with tears. Grieving is a healthy reaction to sadness. Humans bond through shared pain. Please do not punish your colleagues for their willingness to be vulnerable with grief-stricken families. Real doctors cry.\n\n\n5) Patients want doctors who cry. Patients are comforted when doctors grieve with them. Vicki Allemand Scott, a mother on Facebook, concurs, “When my daughter passed away the doctors and nurses formed a wall in front of us until she was gone. ALL of these wonderful people were crying just as much as we were. I will never forget the kindness and compassion we were shown by these special people.”\n\n\n6) Real men cry. Men are socialized not to cry. This photo honors a man for having the courage to cry. A son, livinbandit, shares:\n\n\nMy dad is an ER doctor, and has been for as long as I’ve been alive, always working nights. He doesn’t usually talk about patients, but he would talk about the gross things he’s had to deal with around the dinner table with the family. The times that I do remember though, however rare they were, were the times he would come home, and cry in my mother’s arms because there was someone that he couldn’t save no matter how hard he tried . . . He didn’t think any of us kids were watching, but I seemed to always see. I’ve never had more respect for my dad then when I would see him cry because he felt like he could have done more . . . Even if he couldn’t have.\n\n\n7) More than anything—doctors need your empathy. What happens when the physician in the photo pulls himself together and gets back to work? One commenter on Reddit, PM_YOUR_PANTY_DRAWER, suggests the sad reality:\n\n\nThe part mos t people fail to realize, is that this man now has to compose himself, walk into another person’s room, and introduce himself with a smile and handshake to the next person. Sometimes healthcare workers walk in to see someone new and before even introducing themselves, out comes; ‘We’ve been sitting here for 45 minutes and . . .’ or ‘That guy next door has been moaning forever and nobody is helping him.’ You literally had to direct yourself 100% at someone grappling with death, and the rest of the show goes on around you.\n\n\nThere’s times where you run, and rush, and hurry, and skip eating, and go 12 hours without urinating, and you’d give your firstborn for a cup of water, and through it all, you lose, you get complained to, and you get zero sympathy from your coworkers or management. I’ve been covered in phlegm, urine, feces, blood, infectious drainage, sweat, and tears. I’ve had to go from ensuring a person continues to breathe, to a room full of angry people because grandma wanted a Tylenol and the call light has been on for 10 minutes, and we’re going to another hospital, and we want another doctor, and this place is getting a call to the administration, and I’m going to call a lawyer, and I’m calling channel 6 news, and we know so-and-so and he’s going to hear about this.\n\n\nHealthcare is a life of fighting, defending yourself, sacrificing yourself, working weekends, missing holidays, and sometimes things like losing a patient makes you want to throw up your hands and say ‘fuck it, I’m out.’ But you can’t. You do it because you love it. You do this thankless and unappreciated job because you want to. I can’t believe I’m in 6-figure debt and gave up the nights and weekends of my 20s so I could voluntarily do it. But I couldn’t see myself doing anything else.\n\n\nOne doctor, jimbomac, has a simple request: “Let me tell you those ‘thank-you’ cards probably mean more to us than you think . . . we do hugely appreciate when people like yourselves take the time to say thanks.”\n\n\n8) Doctors who don’t grieve get sick. Unprocessed grief is dangerous for human health. My Facebook friend, Joe Jacobs, writes:\n\n\nI had a friend who was consuming heavy amounts of cocaine in the 80s trying to deal with a doctor’s life. He was a Cedars doctor making big bucks and living a prestigious life so I asked him why and he responded with. Paraphrase: I’m an oncologist who thought I would be able to help using the latest cure methods. I find myself head of the ward of incurables and it is my job to ease their pain and watch them die and then watch the response of family members to the outcomes.\n\n\n9) If you don’t cry, you die. In my recent article, Physician Bullying: ‘Not Allowed to Cry’ I discuss unprocessed grief as a root cause of physician bullying, abuse, depression—even suicide. Both men I dated in med school died by suicide. Brilliant physicians. One overdosed at a medical conference. The other overdosed after work. In just over a year, we lost three physicians in my town to suicide. Gunshot wounds, mostly. One local doc lost seven colleagues to suicide—so far. Our profession punishes doctors for grieving and restricts the medical licenses of those seeking mental health care. So rather than process our grief, many docs turn to alcohol, drugs, firearms.\n\n\n10) The physician in this photo is a modern day hero.\n\nPamela Wible, M.D., is a family physician and pioneer in the ideal medical care movement. She hosts physician retreats to help her colleagues heal from grief and reclaim their lives and careers.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO GET RID OF ASHES | FFFW 229\n\n\n\n\nEli Gable\nMarch 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverstory Partners Announces Industry-Changing, Tech-Focused Advancements in Planning End-of-Life Services\n\n\n\n\nCDFuneralNews\nMarch 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart Loans for Funeral Homes: Build, Buy & Grow | Take It to the Bank Ep. 13\n\n\n\n\nCDFuneralNews\nMarch 20, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad Comments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Daily Email Updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Metal Report Provided By: Cremation Recycling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO GET RID OF ASHES | FFFW 229\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverstory Partners Announces Industry-Changing, Tech-Focused Advancements in Planning End-of-Life Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart Loans for Funeral Homes: Build, Buy & Grow | Take It to the Bank Ep. 13\n\n\n\n Job Posts Powered By: Deathcarejobs.com"

But a Nevada politician's assertion that Biden's kiss on the back of her head made her feel uncomfortable prompted some Democrats to question whether the 76-year-old is too out of step with his own party to run a successful 2020 presidential campaign.",

Jacob and a few friends were on the rocky shore above me, but that felt far away. It was just me alone on the 20m tall face with the sounds of the crashing Mediterranean. I stopped at some pockets about halfway up, and leaned my head out from the wall to try to get a closer look at what probably was the crux. Just then, I heard a sound and looked up. Jacob appeared over the lip, rappelling down the rope. He quickly fumbled to get his iPhone out so he could capture the moment. Everything seemed to line up perfectly. The sun was casting the most beautiful golden glow, Jacob was in the ideal location on a rope to shoot, and I set off into the crux letting out a power shout to stick a wild lunge for a juicy tufa pinch. It definitely can take a lot of work and extra logistics to document these adventures. Sometimes in moments like this though, it just comes together suddenly and there’s no other time like the present to react quickly and take hold of the opportunity. Ejector seat - 7c - onsight ✅ Thanks for the cool footage Jacob! And for being an awesome adventure buddy as always 🙂\"",
      "Jacob Cook on Instagram: \"I’ve been thinking a lot about scale of climbing objectives recently. One of the ways i’ve been approaching Golden Gate is similar to how one might approach a single pitch sport project. Except each bolt is scaled up to a whole pitch! I’ve been doing these link days where I rap in and lead out on the top portion of the route, each time i’ll go a few pitches lower. Each session i’m building up my mental picture of the climbing: key gear placements, sequences, important holds. It’s impossible to remember everything in the detail I would on a single pitch, so it’s really important to focus on exactly the details that matter. The notes app on my phone at this point looks like this giant string of code! 😂 This photo was from near the top on my longest upper link so far - from the move pitch to the top. I like it because you can tell I’m just loving being up there. It’s easy for a mega project like this to start feeling like hard work, the way to keep things light is to feel the joy that comes from climbing light and flowy on the golden stone. Thanks @johnkasaian for the support that day!\"",

      "Exceptional Denver artist Austin Zucchini-Fowler has created an extraordinary mural, as a heartfelt thank you to the amazingly courageous and dedicated work",
      "Have you seen the latest mural to pop up on Colfax?",
      "SHOW OF SUPPORT: A Denver-based artist created a mural depicting a health care worker adorned with angel wings and packing a pair of boxing gloves in...",
      "Austin Zucchini-Fowler is a Denver street artist that is showing his gratitude towards front line workers through his street art.",
      "In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, nurses can make more than $6,200 a week. A recent posting for a job in Fargo, North Dakota, offered more than $8,000 a week. Some can get as much as $10,000.",
      "Austin Zucchini Fowler, a coach of DU’s Hilltoppers club swimming team, wanted to make public his appreciation for those on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fowler, who attended DU’s School of Art and Art History from 2007 to 2011, spray-painted a series of large-scale murals on building walls throughout downtown Denver featuring teachers, health care workers, first responders and others on the front lines. “The first responder piece is particularly meaningful to me because my oldest brother is not only a doctor, but he’s also in the U.S. Army,” Fowler says. “The piece represents some of the cool stuff that he’s done over the past couple of years.” Fowler created his first mural — a nurse with wings and boxing gloves — in April on a blank wall on East Colfax Avenue. The response took him by surprise. “I was getting the most incredible e-mails from health care workers,” he says. “The coolest thing they were giving me feedback on was that it boosted morale in the hospital. It was something to talk about, something to visit. A lot of them would go and take pictures in front of it — and they felt empowered. They were so grateful for the message.” Encouraged by the feedback — and the business owners who began asking him to create similar artwork on their walls — Fowler decided to create a series of murals to express the gratitude of an entire city. “I love the community aspect of public work. I wanted the thank you and gratitude not just to come from me, but from the community,” he says. “I’m not the only one who is feeling grateful right now. It was cool to send a message that a lot of people are feeling and represent the community as a whole in that way.”",

      "Contralto, pianist, pedagogist, administrator, and advocate Lulu Vere Childers had a profound impact on African American Spirituals and European classical music. Childers was the seventh child of 12 born in Dry Ridge, Kentucky, on February 28, 1870, to former enslaved parents, Alex Childres and Eliza Butler Childers originally from New Orleans, Louisiana. Lulu’s siblings were Agnes A. Childers, Della A. Childers, Elizabeth Childers, Hester Childers, Jasper Childers, Martha Childers, Mollie Childres, Nancy Childers Webb, Sebastian Childers, Susan A. Childers, and Esther Smithson from a previous relationship. After being mistreated by the mistress of the plantation, in 1872, the family moved to Howell, Michigan. Childers graduated from Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio in 1896, receiving a Bachelor of Music degree in Voice and Piano from the College’s Conservatory of Music. From 1898 to 1900, she was the music director at Wiley University, Marshall, Texas. While teaching in Texas, she performed with the Eckstein Norton Music Company, an African American school in Cane Spring, Kentucky developed by the Afro-Canadian pianist and pipe organist, Harriet Gibbs Marshall. Her performances were designed to assist with raising money for the operation of the Cane Springs Music Department. Childers next headed the Music Department at Knoxville […]",
      "On June 2, 1863, Harriet Tubman led 150 black Union soldiers, who were part of the U.S. 2nd South Carolina Volunteers, in the Combahee River Raid and liberated more than 700 enslaved people. Tubman, often referred to as “the Moses of her people,” was a former slave who had fled to freedom in 1849. Throughout the 1850s, she returned to her native Maryland to bring other enslaved people north into freedom, first to Pennsylvania and then eventually to Canada. Tubman had worked mainly through the Underground Railroad in the 1850s. By 1862, however, she left her home in Auburn, New York to work in the Union-occupied Hilton Head area of South Carolina as a nurse and spy during the Civil War. In 1863, Colonel James Montgomery asked her to lead a secret military mission against Confederates in South Carolina. With the support of Union gunboats, she and members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteers traveled into Confederate territory to free enslaved people and destroy wealthy rice plantations. Some of the formerly enslaved men were recruited into the army. On the night of June 1, 1863, three federal gunboats set sail from Beaufort, South Carolina traveling up the Combahee River. Tubman […]",

Senator Obama addressed the audience gathered in Brown A.M.E. Church in Selma. Here is his speech. Here today, I must begin because at the Unity breakfast this morning I was saving for last and the list was so long I left him out after that introduction.

      "«§» 20 May 2013In a stunning example of a soap opera come to life, a video has surfaced from Brazil that depicts the hilarious struggle of a man attempting to escape a cheating woman’s bedroom after her husband has come home.And it’s out a third story window.As the drama begins, a husband and wife are seen arguing on the third-floor patio of an urban apartment building.High drama: An hysterical Brazilian video captures high wire drama of a married woman's paramour escaping shirtless out the window as her jilted husband arrives‘Who shirt is this,’ demands the husband in Portuguese.The wife angrily flings the shirt into a whooping crowd that has gathered below.Their fight is juicy enough as is, but just off to the side a man appears in the couple's window.Shirtless and angry, the man may be an adulterer but he's awfully quick-thinking. Adulterer with acumen: Like something out of Benny Hill, the shirtless man ties together a rope of clothes and out he goesAudience: Meanwhile, a crowd gathers below, laughing at the men and taunting them. 'Cornudo!' they yelled at the jilted husdandHe tosses out the window an escape rope he's managed to fashion from knotted t-shirts and bravely begins to climb down.On a window sill below, he stops. The cackling crowd mocks both him and the woman’s husband.‘Cornudo,’ the growing audience yells at the husband, a Portuguese word for a man being cheated on.JUMP! The crowd dares him to leap and he does. Luckily, firemen have set up a cushion on the streetSafe: Shirtless and angry, the man lands on the cushion as the crowd cackles at his silly situationAs if a Hollywood celebrity had just fallen from the sky, the passersby hoot and ogle and snap photos.They chant ‘JUMP!’ as emergency workers arrive to assist the struggling man. And he does just that.A soft mat is placed below the shirtless man and the crowd cheers as leaps and bounces down to the street.Barefoot and scowling, the shirtless man gives the woman and her husband a good shake of the fist, then shakes it at the crowd for good measure and marches out of view.The end: The man shakes his fist at the couple he left behind and then admonishes the highly entertained crowd before stomping, barefooted, out of view http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abmi7A9_0pk",

      "The feisty Black-capped Chickadee is the most common and widespread of the seven chickadee species found in North America.",
      "Species accounts for all the birds of the world.",
      "A bird almost universally considered “cute” thanks to its oversized round head, tiny body, and curiosity about everything, including humans. The chickadee’s black cap and bib; white cheeks; gray back, wings, and tail; and whitish underside with buffy sides are distinctive. Its habit of investigating people and everything else in its home territory, and quickness to discover bird feeders, make it one of the first birds most people learn.",
      "This tiny, plump-bodied, big-headed bird is a familiar woodland resident and backyard visitor in the northern U.S. and Canada. Gray overall with light buffy flanks and a contrasting head pattern: black cap, white cheek, and black throat. Short, stubby bill is used for hammering open seeds. Often the core of mixed flocks of songbirds. Visits feeders. Nearly identical to Carolina Chickadee, but range barely overlaps. Especially note voice, brighter white on wings, and buffier flanks on Black-capped. Beware that hybrids occur frequently in the overlap zone and some are best left unidentified.",
      "Browse North American birds by shape—helpful if you don’t know exactly which type of bird you’ve seen."

      "House Democrats have passed the most ambitious effort in decades to overhaul policing. The sweeping measure bans chokeholds and “qualified immunity” for law enforcement while easing requirements for prosecutors to pursue misconduct charges.",
      "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats proposed a far-reaching overhaul of police procedures and accountability Monday, a sweeping legislative response to the mass protests denouncing the deaths of black Americans in the hands of law enforcement. The political outlook is deeply uncertain for the legislation in a polarized election year. President Donald Trump is staking out a tough \"law and order” approach in the face of the outpouring of demonstrations and demands to re-imagine policing in America.",
