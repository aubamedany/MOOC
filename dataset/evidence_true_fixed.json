        "image_caption": "Image not found;California wildfires!\nUnfortunately, forest fires such as burgers, sun, sandy beaches and the deep blue sea belong to the sunny state of California. They are feared and always present, because just a small spark is usually enough to trigger a huge fire.\nA few months before our trip to California, the pictures and videos of the Thomas Fire went around the world. Many have empathized with this country and its poor people, who lost all their belongings overnight.\nWatch this video on YouTube\nDuring our last visit in May this year, despite new growth, traces of the devastating forest fires in California could still be seen everywhere.\n\nThe fire, known to everyone under the name Thomas Feuer, ignited on December 4 in Santa Paula. It was driven westward at a rapid pace by strong Santa Ana winds from the dry interior of the country. The speed reached up to 4,800 square meters per second. Many people in parts of Ventura only had a few moments to get out of their homes in time.\nIt burned for over a month and was considered the biggest fire in California's history so far. Large parts of Southern California were engulfed in the flames, with around 18,000 hectares falling victim to the fire.\nDrive through Los Padres National Forests to Ojai!\nWe like to drive through the Los Padres National Forests to Ojai with our little grandson, eat ice cream in town and visit the great playground. The trip there offers great views of wild mountains and wild gorges, and the winding roads are lined with lemon trees and colorful flowers. There is hardly any traffic and you can enjoy the wonderful view of the impressive landscape.\n\nThis time everything was different, we were shaken!\nThe wildfires in California have also destroyed large areas of Los Padres National Forest north of Ojai. The view of the burnt down bare landscape on the hills was terrible for us and even the sparsely growing new green doesn't change that. On the contrary, it makes you even more aware of how much the fire has done to you.\n \nSanta Barbara, Montecito and Carpinteria!\nThere are favorite places in California that we visit several times with every stay. So we all go to Santa Barbara together very often, walk around town, have a drink or simply enjoy an ice cream.\nBut sometimes we all go to the zoo together, which is not big but very nicely laid out.\n \nFrom time to time, we take the descent to Carpinteria just before Santa Barbara and make a detour to the beach. Our grandson, like all children, loves running into the waves and frolicking in the water. We like to let him enjoy himself and play along with the game.\nThe beach there is uniquely beautiful and not nearly as crowded as in Santa Monica, for example. It is a real secret tip and is definitely worth a stop there.\n \nCarpinteria is located right next to the well-known luxury town of Montecito, where the villas of some of California's richest citizens are located.\n \nSure, people in Germany have heard a lot about it, including that Montecito and parts of Santa Barbara were evacuated. Seeing with our own eyes what damage the wildfires in California have unfortunately also left behind in these places was very close to us.\n \nThe contrast of palm trees and colorful blooming flowers in the foreground, to bare, burnt hills in the background was a shocking sight.\n \nFirefighters are fighting wildfires in California again!\nClouds of smoke are currently darkening the Californian sky again and thousands of firefighters are fighting the flames, which are spreading like a tornado.\nFor example, the Ferguson fire, which led to the closure of the famous Yosemite National Park for several days due to very heavy smoke development. Or the Carr fire, which has reduced parts of the village of Redding to rubble since Monday.\nWatch this video on YouTube\nThis fire, which broke out at the beginning of the week, has so far destroyed almost 42,000 hectares, which is an area larger than Denver. It cost the lives of six people and destroyed more than 900 buildings. The fire is considered to be the worst of the large-scale fires in California's history.\nAccording to experts, the situation will be aggravated by the high temperatures and the prolonged drought.\nThe fire risk in California continues to rise, the population has been warned.\n\n\n\nTweet share Remember like:Like Loading...\n\nSimilar posts\n\n\n\nDiscover more from My Travel Diary USA\nSign up for a subscription to receive the latest posts via email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Enter your email address... \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n subscribing"

        "description": "Nowadays, it might seem harder than ever to truly know what is true and what is fake. Huge amounts of disinformation and media manipulation are being spread on the internet. Social media play a big part in this as everyone has access to it, and everyone can post whatever they think and believe. Generally we would see this as a good thing, but false information is being spread with severe consequences. It has become very easy to be a criminal from your own bedroom and pretend to be someone you are not. How do we keep a grip on the information society now that artificial intelligence is getting involved in the manipulation game? Digital technology is giving us something close to superpowers. Will we use them to obliterate the distinctions between authenticity and inauthenticity, reality and virtuality, human and machine? Or will we find a way to use technology in service of fighting what\u2019s fake? Thijs Pepping is a humanistic trend analyst and the co-author of the book Real Fake. In this lecture, he will take you on a deep dive into the game we humans play with reality. According to Pepping, we are on the brink of entering a completely new chapter in our history, with new rules and new possibilities.",

The story accompanying it was that the impala had sacrificed herself to the cheetahs in order for her offspring to escape.

        "author": "",
        "description": "Think your weekday commute is rough? China's G4 Beijing-Hong Kong-Macau Expressway make U.S. highways look like a breeze. Just recently, the G4 experienced one of the world's worst traffic jams of all time. The monumental jam occurred during the country's Golden Week, which is is a national holiday in China that aims to commemorate the founding of People's Republic of China. According to the Telegraph, the traffic jam was caused by a combination of a new checkpoint, the reduction of open lanes from 50 to 20, and foggy weather. Of course, the fact that it was a holiday is likely to have a played a role in the backup as well. Officials said that more than 740 million people -- half of China's population -- were expected to travel over the week as part of the Golden Week celebrations.Many motorists are seen exiting their vehicles as they wait for the traffic to clear. This shouldn't come as a surprise, though, considering that most cars were stuck here for hours.In an interview with reports, Wen Humin, deputy directory of Beijing Transportation Research Centre, revealed that worst days for traffic usually occur during major holidays and bad weather. He goes on to day that traffic jams lasting 3-4 hours, sometimes even longer, are common during peak traffic times around the Chinese capital.\"The worst days are normally when cars with tail numbers of 4 and 9 are banned from entering the city centre. During rainy and bad weather days, or before and after major holidays, traffic congestion is particularly bad. On these days, traffic jams can last more than three to four hours and even longer,\" said Wen Huimin, deputy director of Beijing Transportation Research Centre.Unfortunately, China has yet to find a solution to its traffic problem. And with 1.357 billion residents and counting, experts suggest that it will only become worse in the years to come. Video: Yep, China has the most insane traffic jams in the planet You can check out the massive G4 traffic jam by clicking the play button above. Captured by an aerial drone flying above, the roughly two-minute-long video shows the chaotic scene as thousands of motorists sit bumper to bumper on the G4. So the next time you think your commute is rough, just remember that motorists went through in this video.",

Reports said that the video surfaced on Monday just after the US troops left Afghanistan. After the video went viral, some social media accounts claimed it was not what it looked like. The man who was seen dangling from the helicopter was actually a Taliban fighter. The fighter was trying to install a Taliban flag from the air, said an account on Twitter. Reports claimed he was trying to install a flag on the governor's office but it didn\u2019t work. Reuters Fact check claimed that the \u2018man is alive, despite the contrary claims\u2019.

It's all over Facebook.<br /><br /><div class=shaded><img alt=bullfighter src=http://hoaxes.org/images/2012bloghoax/bullfighter.jpg><br /><br />And suddenly, I looked at the bull. He had this innocence... that all animals have in their eyes, and he looked at me with this pleading. It was like a cry for justice, deep down inside of me. I describe it as being like a prayer - because if one confesses, it is hoped, that one is forgiven. I felt like the worst shit on earth. <br /><br />This photo shows the collapse of Torrero Alvaro Munera, as he realized in the middle of his last fight... the injustice to the animal. From that day forward he became an opponent of bullfights.</div><br />I haven't been able to figure out where the photo originally came from, but it definitely doesn't show Alvaro Munera's moment of epiphany during a bullfight. Munera is an ex-bullfighter who's become an animal-rights activist. But (as described in an article about him on <a href=http://open.salon.com/blog/addisonpg/2012/03/05/alvaro_munera_an_ex-bullfighter_tells_why_he_became_an_animal_rights_activist>open.salon.com</a>) his career ended not from a moment of zen communion with a bull, but rather in 1984 when a bull caught him and tossed him in the air, resulting in a spinal-cord injury that left Munera paralyzed.<br /><br />I've seen <a href=http://blissful-awareness.tumblr.com/post/16656133764/and-suddenly-the-bull-looked-at-me-with-the>another version</a> of the photo and quotation that attributes the words to Fabian Oconitrillo Gonzalez.

I had more people come screaming up to my house than ever. Great stories. But two things made me take it down. First, the cops advised me that it would cause traffic accidents as they almost wrecked when they drove by. Second, a 55 year old lady grabbed the 75 pound ladder almost killed herself putting it against my house and didn\u2019t realize it was fake until she climbed to the top (she was not happy). By the way, she was one of many people who attempted to do that. My yard couldn\u2019t take it either. I have more than a few tire tracks where people literally drove up my yard. It was fun while it lasted Hope you get a kick out of it too! I thought it was pretty creative, but can totally see why the poor guy had to take it down! It\u2019s something I\u2019d do but my wife would make me take it down long before the police would get a chance too! Merry\u2026 Continue reading",

Both humorous and melancholy, these images emphasize the gap be tween the natural world and its synthetic imitations.;Image not found"

We begin our journey from Maydan \u2013 Kyiv main square and the 2013-2014 revolution centre. Our guide, who was the eyewitness of the historic moment, will share his memories of those shocking events. We stroll to the mysterious Chimaera House and the monumental presidential palace along the street, where in 2014 the demonstrators equipped only with wooden shields marched against the police\u2019s bullets. After visiting the government quarter we travel out of the city to the residence of the former president, who fled during the revolution. It used to be the most secret place hidden behind the 5-metre walls heavily guarded by armed men with dogs. Nowadays it\u2019s the Museum of Corruption. There was even a personal air defense system. Explore 137 hectares of parks and lakes on an electric car. There is everything you can imagine \u2013 the ship-restaurant, the heliport, the zoo, the collection of retro cars, golf court, fountains and SPAs \u2013 it was still not enough. The true gem of the residence is the masterpiece of Finnish design \u2013 Honka. It is a modern 600 square meter palace made of unique kelo wood. Walk the underground tunnel guarded by a stuffed lion and the knights, admire royal parquet flooring and wood engravings, hear the stories about the golden loaf and other stupid whims of the dictator. Our guide is a former demonstrator, who was among the first to enter the mansion and has been living there ever since. He committed himself to maintain and protect the house. Enjoy lunch at the roofed terrace on the canal bank.",

I worked largely from Islamabad, where the US embassy had a single mid-level State Department official monitoring events in Afghanistan and a consulate with a small staff in Peshawar, near the border. No doubt there were CIA agents in touch with them, if they were not agents themselves, but their sources of information were largely Afghan exiles living in Pakistan and newspaper reports from journalists who ventured inside the country. In short, however energetically and enthusiastically, they collected much the same information that a competent journalist would have at the time. This left the US largely ignorant about the inner workings of the Taliban organization and its connections with bin Laden.",

The Infernales of Salta won at home in a resounding 94-78, and that way, they went 1-0 in the best-of-three series. The second match will be next Thursday in Venado Tuerto. With more than significant casualties such as Ferraro's injury and that of the infernal goal scorer, Diego Peralta, from Salta, who suffers from a strong flu-like illness, the local cast jumped into the decimated game rectangle, but not for that reason, with the firm intention of asserting their strength and keeping the first game. Ricardo De Cecco's team from Salta played two very good first quarters, not only cutting the visitor's offensive circuit, with strong individual defenses but also sometimes parked almost in the area. Salta was intelligent in attack and damaged by spinning the ball, although each one had the basket between eyebrows and eyebrows, he also looked at the best positioned teammate. Of course he made use of one of his favorite tools, the quick transition, intercepting defensive rebounds and running the field. On the visit when the explosiveness of the former Salta Basket, De Miguel, dissipated, so did the Centenario game. And all that great game played in the first half by the people of Salta was reflected again in the third period. With two and a half minutes left until the final, Salta scored 22 points difference from those led by Fernando Aguilar, a difference that was thanks to the defense and the bombs of three -Pereyra, Gago, Torino- and the enormous deployment of leaders Binda, Mart\u00ednez, Schoppler and Quiroga. In the last period, Salta maintained the difference and achieved a resounding victory at home against Centenario.\u201d",

It didn't happen. We don't just go out and kill alligators just because they are there. I don't know why anyone would perpetuate something like that, he said. There is a lot that comes across the Internet that is fabricated, said Arkansas Game and Fish Commission Lt. Don Albright...<br />According to the photograph's accompanying text, Evening Shade, Ark., residents Charles and Anita Rogers, who may or may not exist, said they could hear bellowing during the evening hours. According to the story, their neighbors attributed the alleged noise to a giant alligator they saw in the pond that runs behind their home.<br />I didn't believe it, Charles Rogers said in the story.<br />Albright said the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission has detained large alligators in the past like the one seen in the picture. However, he said the organization has a policy to protect the alligators rather than shooting them, hanging their remains from a suspended crane and taking pictures of their trophy.</i><br /><br />But how exactly is it fake? That's not clear to me. Is it the caption that's fake? Or has the image been photoshopped? <a href=http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/wcgator.asp target=_blank>Snopes</a> suspects the image is genuine, but has the incident occurring in Texas.",

Think of it as chicken soup with several cups of sugar mixed in: It's supposed to be a method of delivering a remedy for what ails you by adding sweetening to make the cure more appealing, but the result is more often a sickly-sweet concoction that induces hyperglycemic fits. In ordinary language, glurge is the sending of inspirational (and supposedly \"true\") tales, ones that often conceal much darker meanings than the uplifting moral lessons they purport to offer or undermine their messages by fabricating and distorting historical fact in the guise of offering a \"true story.\" Many of us, it seems, cannot overcome the urge to glurge.",

The photo, taken by photographer Andrew L\u00f3pez, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1960, as can be seen on the official website of the award. There they explain that the man who appears kneeling in the image was actually a corporal in the Batista Army \u201cexecuted by a firing squad\u201d of Fidel Castro. This was also indicated by the organizers of the Pulitzer Prizes in a 2016 Facebook post. The man was a soldier in the Batista Army who was \u201csentenced to death for war crimes\u201d, according to the Pulitzer Prizes. In this Facebook post, another image is included in which the convicted person already appears in front of the wall, whose caption states that he had been \u201csentenced to death for war crimes\u201d and that the trial had lasted \u201cexactly one minute.\u201d The image also appears in the archive of the Getty Images agency, where she was placed in the Cuban city of Matanzas on January 17, 1959. In the description, they indicate that the corporal was called Jos\u00e9 Cipriano Rodr\u00edguez and that he had been convicted \u201cfor the deaths of two brothers\u201d, while the priest is identified as Domingo Lorenzo. The author of the photo and the priest who appears in it say that the man who was shot was Cabo. After searching for information about the religious, we found that he gave his version of what happened in a column published on ABC on November 22, 1962, which is available in his archive. There, Lorenzo explains that the man was called Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez (although he also names him \u201cPepe Caliente\u201d) and that he had been \u201ca corporal in the Army of General F. Batista Zaldivar.\u201d The priest admits that he never knew \u201cwhat they were accusing him of, because between that shouting you couldn't hear the charges being made\u201d, but that in any case he was sentenced to \u201cdeath penalty by shooting\u201d by Castro commander William G\u00e1lvez, who ordered that the execution be carried out at that very moment, although he ended up delaying it the next day. \u201ca lot of women\u201d Present.

You can check out the priest's full testimony here. In an excerpt from the book Picture This! The Inside Story and Classic Photos of UPI Newspictures, L\u00f3pez clarifies that he did deliver a reel but that he kept the one containing the photos of Pepe (referring to 'Pepe Caliente'). In any case, the photographer also identifies the prisoner as a corporal and assures that, although the trial itself lasted two hours, it took only a minute for the three judges of the court to sentence him to death.

As can be seen in this article reviewing the lives of L\u00f3pez and other award-winning photographers, UPI itself also points out that 'Pepe Caliente' had been part of Batista's Army. This is also indicated by the Cuban magazine Bohemia, which in its edition of February 1, 1959, included an article on the trial and execution of Corporal Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez. In the text, they specify that Rodr\u00edguez had been part of the squad of the Cuban municipality of  Jovellanos and that \u201che was found convicted of numerous crimes\u201d. In addition, Bohemia points out that the man shot confessed to the murder of two brothers, which Damn. ES has not been able to verify independently. In short, the photographer who captured the image, the priest, the UPI and Getty Images agencies, the organizers of the Pulitzer Prizes and the Bohemia Magazine state that the man in the photo who was shot was a corporal in the Fulgencio Batista Army and not a \u201cCuban peasant\u201d who refused \u201cto work for the Castro regime\u201d.\n\n\n Primera\n date\n of\n publishing\n of\n this\n article: 08/10/2020;Labels\n\n\n prize \n\n\n\n Photo \n\n\n\n Cuba \n\n\n\n Shooting \n\n\n\n Che Guevara \n\n\n\n Castro \n\n\n\n Fidel Castro \n\n\n\n peasant \n\n\n\n Shot \n\n\n\n Pulitzer \n\n\n\n Che \n\n\n\nA photo of an alleged \u201cCuban peasant\u201d who would be receiving \u201cthe last blessing\u201d from a priest before being shot by order of Che Guevara for refusing to \u201cwork for the Castro regime\u201d is circulating on the networks.

However, although it is true that he won that award, it is a hoax that he was a peasant or that he was shot for that reason: both the author of the image and the priest who appears in it, as well as the United Press International (UPI) and Getty Images agencies, the organizers of the Pulitzer Prizes and the Bohemia Magazine assure that the man shot, named Jose Cipriano Rodr\u00edguez, had been a corporal in the Army of which Fulgencio Batista was president of Cuba and not a \u201cCuban peasant\u201d who refused \u201cto work for the Castro regime\u201d.\n\ud83d\udcf2 Click here and follow the Maldita.es WhatsApp channel so you don't get lost! \nAccording to the Pulitzer Prize organization, Rodr\u00edguez was executed for \u201cwar crimes\u201d, while the Getty Images agency and the Cuban magazine Bohemia indicate that he was killed after being accused of murdering two brothers. The photo, taken by photographer Andrew L\u00f3pez, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1960, as can be seen on the official website of the award. There they explain that the man who appears kneeling in the image was actually a corporal in the Batista Army \u201cexecuted by a firing squad\u201d of Fidel Castro. This was also indicated by the organizers of the Pulitzer Prizes in a 2016 Facebook post. The man was a soldier in the Batista Army who was \u201csentenced to death for war crimes\u201d, according to the Pulitzer Prizes. In this Facebook post, another image is included in which the convicted person already appears in front of the wall, whose caption states that he had been \u201csentenced to death for war crimes\u201d and that the trial had lasted \u201cexactly one minute.\u201d The image also appears in the archive of the Getty Images agency, where she was placed in the Cuban city of Matanzas on January 17, 1959. In the description, they indicate that the corporal was called Jos\u00e9 Cipriano Rodr\u00edguez and that he had been convicted \u201cfor the deaths of two brothers\u201d, while the priest is identified as Domingo Lorenzo. The author of the photo and the priest who appears in it say that the man who was shot was Cabo. After searching for information about the religious, we found that he gave his version of what happened in a column published on ABC on November 22, 1962, which is available in his archive. There, Lorenzo explains that the man was called Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez (although he also names him \u201cPepe Caliente\u201d) and that he had been \u201ca corporal in the Army of General F. Batista Zaldivar.\u201d The priest admits that he never knew \u201cwhat they were accusing him of, because between that shouting you couldn't hear the charges being made\u201d, but that in any case he was sentenced to \u201cdeath penalty by shooting\u201d by Castro commander William G\u00e1lvez, who ordered that the execution be carried out at that very moment, although he ended up delaying it the next day. \u201ca lot of women\u201d Present. According to Domingo Lorenzo, the commander demanded that the photographers \u201chand over all the reels of their cameras with the negatives\u201d and that \u201call but one American delivered them\u201d, referring to Andrew L\u00f3pez. You can check out the priest's full testimony here. In an excerpt from the book Picture This! The Inside Story and Classic Photos of UPI Newspictures, L\u00f3pez clarifies that he did deliver a reel but that he kept the one containing the photos of Pepe (referring to 'Pepe Caliente'). In any case, the photographer also identifies the prisoner as a corporal and assures that, although the trial itself lasted two hours, it took only a minute for the three judges of the court to sentence him to death. The full extract is available on the website of The Downhold Project, an initiative dedicated to disseminating historical information about the United Press International (UPI) agency, for which Andrew L\u00f3pez worked.\n Do you think you've received a hoax?

As can be seen in this article reviewing the lives of L\u00f3pez and other award-winning photographers, UPI itself also points out that 'Pepe Caliente' had been part of Batista's Army. This is also indicated by the Cuban magazine Bohemia, which in its edition of February 1, 1959, included an article on the trial and execution of Corporal Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez. In the text, they specify that Rodr\u00edguez had been part of the squad of the Cuban municipality of  Jovellanos and that \u201che was found convicted of numerous crimes\u201d. In addition, Bohemia points out that the man shot confessed to the murder of two brothers, which Damn. ES has not been able to verify independently. In short, the photographer who captured the image, the priest, the UPI and Getty Images agencies, the organizers of the Pulitzer Prizes and the Bohemia Magazine state that the man in the photo who was shot was a corporal in the Fulgencio Batista Army and not a \u201cCuban peasant\u201d who refused \u201cto work for the Castro regime\u201d.\n\n\n Primera\n date\n of\n publishing\n of\n this\n article: 08/10/2020"
