The Hong Kong Police Force had been linked to a digital network that utilized facial recognition technology, fueling protesters' fears of surveillance and national security concerns. This incident is related to the story of Simon Cheng, a former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate, and the actions of activist Joshua Wong, who was arrested ahead of planned protests. The use of facial recognition technology has been put on hold in other cities, such as Adelaide, due to privacy concerns."
