        "description": "The Special Perils is an additional coverage which motorist can opt for to cover from loss or damage caused by natural disasters such as floods, storms, earthquakes, landslides and so on.",
        "text": "![](https://allianz.renewinsurance.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/car-flooded-1024x768.jpg)\nThe Special Perils is an additional coverage which motorist can opt for to cover from loss or damage caused by natural disasters such as floods, storms, earthquakes, landslides and so on. The actual policy wording is:\n\u201cIn consideration of the additional premium that You paid Us for this endorsement, We agree that the insurance provided under Section A of this Policy will cover loss or damage to Your Car caused by flood, typhoon, hurricane, storm, tempest, volcanic eruption, earthquake, landslide, landslip, subsidence or sinking of the soil / earth or other convulsions of nature.\u201d\nThe take up rate for Special Perils coverage has increased steady from 11% to 22% according to Allianz General Insurance.\nOne of the reasons for a higher take up rate is due to the massive flood in Dec 2021 where many motorists are caught off guard and witness their vehicles being damaged by the flood. Secondly, more motorist are now willing to add-on Special Perils coverage due to the reduction in premium. Special Perils rate has been reduced tremendously by more than 50%. From a rate of 0.5% of sum insured to 0.2%. Thus, a vehicle with a sum coverage of RM80,000, the premium for including Special Perils would be RM160.\nMany a times, a motorist would opt for the cheapest premium without considering any add-on coverage, not knowing that there are certain events that the standard motor insurance does not cover. When there is a storm or heavy rain and assuming your car was damages due to falling tree, the damage will not be covered under your standard comprehensive insurance, unless you have add-on for Special Perils.\nThus, with the reduction in the premium rate for Special Perils, it is advisable to add-on when you renew your insurance. If you have recently renewed your car insurance and wish to add-on now for Special Perils, you may contact your agent to assist you to pass an endorsement.",

Updated 7:35 p.m. (GMT-5)\nARMY OPERATION | Criminals have fled\nPart of the arsenal seized in the dismantling of the Los Zetas camp. | Efe\nSixty soldiers attacked a training camp of the 'Los Zetas' cartel in Nuevo Le\u00f3n this Tuesday from helicopters and ground vehicles. During the operation, a hit man died and an arsenal was seized: more than 230 long and short weapons, 60 grenades and rocket launchers, as well as vans and communication systems.\nFour Mexican Air Force helicopters arrived at the Los Zetas camp, located in a rural area of the municipality of Higueras, 45 kilometers northeast of Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. \u201cAround 50 assassins who were in the camp began to flee when they heard helicopter engines,\u201d said a military source.\nFrom the air, the military shot at some of the gunmen and others were chased by personnel who arrived by land at the camp. One of the criminals fell dead 500 meters from the camp, after soldiers discovered him hiding in the trees. The rest of the assassins managed to flee into a mountainous area near the camp.\nThe Los Zetas cartel, which emerged from elite military deserters, is one of the most violent groups in the country and originally served as the armed wing of the powerful Gulf drug cartel, for which it murdered rivals, police and military personnel.\nAt the beginning of this year, that alliance broke down and now the Gulf and Los Zetas are fighting a bloody war, mainly in the states of Nuevo Le\u00f3n and its neighbor of Tamaulipas, in the Gulf of Mexico.\nOn the other hand, the State Attorney General, Alejandro Garza y Garza, has reported that there are already 12 municipal police officers in Monterrey arrested this Tuesday by Army personnel to be investigated for their alleged relationship with organized crime gangs.",

        "text": "The most violent drug cartel in Mexico. The history of the Los Zetas group\nAbout 40 years ago, in the 1980s, Mexico's criminal world began to flourish again. During this period, criminals, primarily those involved in drug trafficking, began to organize into large groups, creating extensive networks for the production, transportation and sale of \u201csubstances\u201d of various kinds. All this has led to competition and widespread conflicts for the right to control territories.\nThe explosive growth in drug trafficking in Mexico was partly due to the victory of the US authorities over the Colombian mafia. More precisely, the US was able to destroy the cocaine supply channels from Colombia to the United States, which led to \u201cunemployment\u201d among Mexican couriers who specialized in transporting drugs.\nThen there was an increase in the number of \u201cdrug businessmen\u201d in Mexico, which was unable to cope with the new scourge, including due to the high level of corruption in all echelons of power.\nHeroin, cocaine, marijuana, synthetic drugs could all be grown and produced locally to meet the high demand for these substances in the US, where addicts were left without a dose. Small groups appeared, which then began to organize into larger ones, then took over \u201cmedium-sized businesses\u201d, and so on, just like in ordinary society, but without an antimonopoly authority.\nOne of the biggest players was the Golfo drug cartel, which was fully developed under the leadership of Juan Nepomuceno Guerra and Juan Garcia Abrego. Born in 1915, Guerra bootlegged back in the 1930s and then followed new trends, but overall he was a dark horse and never got a real sentence in his life. The much younger Abrego started his career in the 1970s as a courier whose ambitions gradually grew.\nThanks to this, he later received \u201crecognition\u201d, becoming the first drug lord on the FBI's list of ten most wanted criminals: by the late 1980s and early 1990s, under his patronage, about 300 tons of cocaine crossed the border between Mexico and the United States annually.\nGradually, Guerra and Abrego retired. Abrego was too eyesore for the US authorities. According to estimates by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1994, the drug lord received about $10 billion from his business every year and organized a network of corrupt officials in Mexico and the United States. In 1995, Abrego was arrested and then extradited to the United States. And Guerra just got too old. The Golfo cartel was led by young Osiel Cardenas Gilien.\nAgainst the background of ever-increasing competition, it became necessary to protect your \u201cinvestments\u201d and \u201cassets\u201d. Popular bandits \u2014 common criminals with \u201cstreet\u201d training \u2014 were often suitable for this purpose, but only for the time being due to their low qualifications and high turnover (in the case of drug wars, this word meant something other than \u201cdismissal by agreement of the parties\u201d or \u201cfor absenteeism\u201d).\nIt was more effective to hire professionals rather than train more and more soldiers with the help of foreign instructors.\nIt is difficult to name the exact date of birth of Los Zetas. Different sources give different starting points. It is believed that it all started with Ruben El Chato Salinas, a retired Mexican lieutenant, whom Guillen hired as his bodyguard. However, Arturo Guzman Desena is often called the founder of Los Zetas. The young man at the time (born in 1976) served in the elite special forces of the Grupo Aerom\u00f3vil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE, now Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales), whose tasks included the fight against drug trafficking.\nWhile in the military, Desena started working part-time for the Golfo cartel. Obviously, he was offered better terms, money and power at the same time, so he retired in 1996 or 1997, and Gilien became his main employer. Impressed by Arturo's skills, and out of fear for his life and a desire to strengthen his position, Guillen said he needed better fighters.\n\u201cThere are only such people in the army,\u201d the answer followed.\nThis was not an obstacle, and Desena quickly lured 34 special forces officers into his new squad \u2014 deserters ready to sacrifice their honor and morals for bonuses (and, as it turned out later, the opportunity not to limit themselves to violence against others).\nBy 1999, when the ongoing war for territory between clans had entered a tough phase, the squad had approximately 40 elite GAFE fighters ranging from soldier to lieutenant. Desena also appeared under the call sign Z-1, hence the band's name, Los Zetas.\nThe head of Golfo gradually gave the Zetas more and more power, expanding their powers, and the cartel found itself at the top of the pyramid, leaving both other clans and governments at the bottom. They could not resist trained militants who knew no restrictions; the drug mafia was superior to them both financially and militarily.\nThe hierarchy began to change gradually in 2002. Then Desena and six other senior Los Zetas officials were killed, and Golfo leader Osiel was later arrested  C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n.\nThis happened in the spring of 2003 after a violent shootout between the military and Los Zetas soldiers. But Cardenas was only extradited to the United States in 2007, where he was sentenced to 25 years without parole.\nLos Zetas was headed by Heriberto Lascano, also a member of the GAFE Special Forces. By about this time, Los Zetas already had more than 300 highly trained military personnel, and authorities called the group \u201cthe most formidable death squad in Mexico's history of organized crime.\u201d Lazcano acted under the call signs Z-3 and El Lazca (Antonio Lucio Morales Betancourt with the call sign Z-2 was arrested back in 2001).\nLascano, by the way, had another nickname \u2014 El Verdugo (\u201cThe Hangman\u201d), which he earned for his extreme cruelty: his specialty was sophisticated torture, and the Z-3 also introduced the \u201cfashion\u201d for decapitating victims. However, it was precisely because of its brutality that Los Zetas frightened not only ordinary people, but also other drug cartels.\nLazcano chose a strategy that was not quite familiar in these parts: instead of trying to negotiate with others, he acted as harshly as possible, forcing him to take control by force.\nSo the killer squad frightened other killers to such an extent that the latter swore allegiance to him. And it was violence that was Lascano's key to power: even his opponents believed that only he could oppose the Sinaloa cartel (now the largest cartel in Mexico). There were no questions about who the successor would be.\nBy 2007, Los Zetas formally remained under the control of the Golfo cartel, despite the fact that it already exceeded its parent company in terms of revenue, membership and influence. However, this did not suit the top of Los Zetas, which began to pull the blanket more actively over themselves, seizing more and more initiatives. The next three years were spent in constant internal conflicts, of which Los Zetas emerged victorious. In 2010, the militants became an independent group that controlled twice as much Mexican territory as its competitors, as well as part of neighboring Guatemala. The drug war was waged, with the Sinaloa, Golfo, Los Zetas cartels and numerous smaller organizations fighting for a redistribution of influence.\nHowever, by this time, Los Zetas had lost professional military personnel, and their shortage was compensated for by super-brutality. In 2010, the San Fernando massacre took place when a mass grave with 72 unnamed migrants was discovered. Los Zetas was afraid they would join Golfo's army. The second San Fernando massacre took place in 2011. This time, 192 people were killed, again due to a possible connection with Golfo.\nThat same year, the Zetas set fire to a casino in Monterrey, a major Mexican city, killing 52 people. In 2012, Los Zetas sparked riots in a prison to free 30 members of the group, killing 44 people. About a year later, 49 decapitated bodies were found on the side of a road near Monterrey, believed to be victims of the Sinaloa war. Los Zetas even \u201cworked\u201d in Guatemala, where 27 farmers were killed. These are just a few examples of cartel brutality.\nSeveral assassins talk about their work.\nYou can find videos online about the real consequences of the cartel's actions, but for ethical reasons we don't publish them.\nHowever, along with its rapidly growing influence (the Zetas were also active in the US, Europe, Venezuela and Africa) and \u201cbusiness diversification\u201d (pirated DVDs and other \u201calmost legal\u201d destinations appeared), Los Zetas faced problems managing the huge monster it had become. The empire began to burst at the seams, and the cartel began to rapidly fragment.\nThe assassination of Heriberto Lascano in 2012 also contributed to this. Also, in order not to create illusions about the impunity of drug cartels, we note that the authorities have entered an active phase of the war against criminals. In addition, the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Los Zetas, which was included in the list of especially dangerous organizations along with the Brotherly Circle, Yamaguchi-gumi and Camorra.\nThe leader for a short time was Miguel Trevi\u00f1o Morales, Z-40, who, according to Los Zetas's tradition, was extremely brutal.\nIt is believed that he was the one who started the war against the Golfo cartel in several regions of Mexico, kidnapping 16 gang members and killing them in 2010. He was accused of outright disloyalty to his former boss Lascano, and when Morales took his place, it turned out that the new chapter would give his predecessor a head start in bloodlust.\nHowever, this was not enough to stay on top of the mountain, especially since most of the first 34 \u201czets\u201d had been arrested or killed by that time, and the United States also awarded a $5 million reward for information about Morales. So he was arrested in 2012, his younger brother Omar (Z-42) took power, but he didn't last long, ending up in police hands in 2015.\nThe era of Los Zetas's dominance is over, although the remnants of the drug empire are still dangerous  continue to operate. Other groups have dismantled the controlled territories; they are also using the approaches introduced by Los Zetas. Today, a cartel made up of military deserters sometimes appears in the news, but more often than not as an example of extreme brutality.\nSources: CNN, La Jornada, PRX, The Guardian, BBC, Council on Foreign Relations, The Sydney Morning Herald, Insight Crime, Latin One, Mexico: Narco-Violence and a Failed State?\nRead also:\nOur Telegram channel.

[email protected]\nIn Mexico, the authorities are losing the war against drug cartels. Why don't bullets or \u201chugs\u201d help? | Hromadi TV\nLast year in Mexico was the bloodiest in decades. 36,000 people were killed. Most of them died in a \u201cwar\u201d between drug cartels and the authorities. Popular President Manuel Obrador's promises to stop violence \u201cwith hugs, not bullets\u201d remain just words so far. And news from some Mexican states is increasingly reminiscent of chronicles from a country torn by a real war.\n\u201cHell Thursday\u201d or the defeat of power in person\nOn October 17, 2019, a squad of 46 intelligence officers surrounded a house in the wealthiest part of Culiac\u00e1n, capital of the northern state of Sinaloa. Ovidio Guzman, the son of Joaquin \u201cShorty\u201d Guzman, former leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in the United States in 2019, was inside unguarded.\nThe military hoped to quickly arrest Guzman and transfer him to the airport in 25 minutes. Another 145 soldiers, divided into four groups, provided cover.\nHowever, the cartel leaders were not caught off guard. Within a few minutes, the first shots rang out, and it became clear that you could forget about the bloodless operation. Hell Thursday has begun, which will end in what may be the most humiliating defeat for the Mexican authorities in the 13 years of the war against drugs.\nGuzman's older brothers mobilized 375 fighters and besieged both the military and almost 800,000 residents of the city for several hours. The events unfolded like this.\nThe chronicle of \u201cHell Thursday\u201d\n17.10.2019\nEach of the four cover groups comes under fire from cartel fighters, who arrived in armored vehicles armed with assault rifles, machine guns and grenade launchers.\n17.10.2019\nOvidio Guzman leaves home. At the request of the military, he asks his brother over the phone to cease fire. He refuses. Drug cartel fighters surround military bases in the city. Exits from the city are blocked to prevent reinforcements from arriving. Thousands of frightened residents are waiting for danger, lying where the shooting caught them \u2014 near cars on the streets, in stores.\n17.10.2019\nMilitants are shelling houses where families of military personnel participating in the operation live. Soldiers captured in different parts of the city become hostages in the hands of the drug cartel. Videos shared on social media show groups of helpless soldiers surrounded by militants.\n17.10.2019\n49 people convicted of serious crimes escape from the local prison. They stop and steal local residents' cars.\nGuzman's older brother promises to attack government facilities in neighboring states.\n17.10.2019\nThe military releases Ovidio Guzman and retreats to avoid further casualties. In a few hours, 14 people were killed, including four civilians and two security officers.

Within a few hours, 14 people were killed in the city, including four civilians and two security officers. Another 18 soldiers were injured\nPhoto:\nEPA-EFE/IVAN MEDINA\nA wave of violence\nThe bloody clashes between drug cartels and law enforcement officers in Mexico are nothing new.\nA few days before the events in Culiac\u00e1n, 13 police officers were killed during an attack on a patrol in Michoac\u00e1n. But the failure of the operation to detain Guzman shocked many: it was not the first time that the drug cartel so openly, in fact live, defied the authorities and won. The \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, which has been going on for 13 years, has not changed the situation for the better.\nMexican cartels began to gain momentum in the late 1980s, following the weakening of Colombian drug traffickers. Gradually, Mexicans gained control over the supply to the United States of cocaine from Colombia, heroin and marijuana from Mexico, and synthetic drugs like methamphetamine and fentanyl from Mexico and China.\nWith the active participation of the United States, Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced the beginning of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d in 2006. To attack the drug cartels, the army was used instead of the police, who were accused, often exonerated, of links to organized crime. Y A few months later, about 20,000 military personnel participated in operations across the country.\nIn the following years, authorities were able to either arrest or kill dozens of cartel leaders.\nSoldiers patrol streets in Tres Palos, Mexico, January 18, 2007. Since 2006, the Mexican army has been actively involved in drug trafficking operations within and outside the country. They have virtually replaced police officers who have discredited themselves with ties to local drug cartels\nPhoto:\nEPA/DAVID DE LA PAZ\nBut that only made things worse. After the cartel leader is removed, a bloody struggle begins between the contenders for his inheritance. The cartel splits into smaller groups that continue to war among themselves and stubbornly oppose government forces. Other cartels also feel their competitors are weakening and are encroaching on their territory.\nAs a result, the homicide rate was the highest in Mexico's history. In 2018, 34,000 people died, and in 2019, already 36,000. During the 13 years of crackdown on cartels in a country of 126 million, about 300,000 people have died.\nAnother 60,000 are missing. Most of them probably ended up in mass graves, which are found almost every day.\nNot only their competitors and law enforcement officers are victims of cartels' struggle for territory and drug transportation channels. Drug cartels kidnap people for ransom, forcibly recruit young people, establish their own laws, and severely punish those who resist.\nIn 2011, 52 people died in Monterrey. They were casino visitors and employees who were set on fire by members of the Los Zetas cartel because the owner refused to pay them for \u201cprotection\u201d.\nRelatives of those killed in a fire in a casino in Monterrey created a memorial on the first anniversary of the tragedy, Mexico, August 25, 2012. Members of the Los Zetas cartel set fire to the casino building because of the owner's debt. The fire killed 52 people \u2014 visitors and employees of the establishment\nPhoto:\nEPA/MIGUEL SIERRA\nIn 2012, 72 illegal migrants who did not want to become murderers in the service of the same cartel were shot dead.\nIn 2014, under still unclear circumstances, 43 students who were protesting against the actions of the local authorities disappeared. According to the official version, they were kidnapped by the police and handed over to the local drug cartel.\nThe victims' relatives also often pay with their lives to demand that the perpetrators be punished. Miriam Rodriguez was killed on May 10, 2017, Mother's Day. The criminals took revenge on her for leading an organization of relatives of drug cartel victims and getting a verdict for the murderer of her 14-year-old daughter.\nBecause the authorities cannot protect the public, in some states, residents form self-defense groups themselves. In January 2020, all of Mexico was shocked by photos of 19 children between 5 and 16 years old armed with rifles. Self-defense in Guerrero has armed children to fight the gang that kidnapped and murdered ten local residents on January 16.\nWomen and children with guns guard the Alcozac\u00e1n community in Guerrero, Mexico, January 14, 2020.

Any help goes a long way.\nThe power of the cartels\nCalderon himself explained the difficulties in the fight against drug cartels. \u201cOur neighbor to the north is the largest consumer of drugs in the world and at the same time the largest arms seller in the world.\u201d Drug cartels earn up to $29 billion annually from selling drugs in the US. About 70% of weapons seized from criminals go to Mexico from the United States.\nHigh revenues allow cartels to attract the best professionals. One of the most powerful and violent criminal organizations (until recently), Los Zetas, is formed from former members of elite Mexican troops.\nDrug cartels have \u201ctheir own people\u201d not only at the local level, but also at the highest level of government and law enforcement agencies.\nIn December 2019, the US arrested former Security Secretary Garcia Luna. He was one of the ideologists of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d who worked closely with American colleagues. Investigators say he helped the Sinaloa cartel avoid prosecution for years in exchange for millions in bribes.\nThe roots of cartel infiltration can be traced back to the political monopoly of the center-left Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has been in power for 71 years and has generally coexisted with drug traffickers in a mutually beneficial manner.\nCartels punish law enforcement officers who refuse to cooperate with them. In May 2008, three Mexican federal police chiefs were murdered by drug cartels in ten days. The number of victims among local police officers exceeds a thousand people.\nThe military is leading the detained head of the Sinaloa drug cartel, Joaquin Guzman Loer a, known as \u201cEl Chapo\u201d, Mexico City, Mexico, February 22, 2014. The drug lord was detained twice and escaped twice, the second time through the sewers. Since 2016, El Chapo has been serving time in prison, from which he escaped in 2015 through a 1.5-kilometer tunnel under his cell\nPhoto:\nEPA/MARIO GUZMAN\nThe new president's \u201chugs instead of bullets\u201d\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who was elected at the end of 2018, promised to change the situation.\nA ruthless critic of Mexico's political elites said the war was over. \u201cWe want peace. We're refusing to hunt cartel leaders. Our goal is to reduce homicides.\u201d The President promised to focus on rehabilitating rather than punishing drug addicts, on creating opportunities for vulnerable segments of the population and on overcoming corruption and poverty. Such promises also dubbed him the words: \u201chugs are not bullets.\u201d\nAccording to many experts, this is a step in the right direction. The researchers argue that authorities should finally address the causes of violence: a toxic combination of poverty, weak state institutions and endemic everyday violence, including within families.\nHowever, this will not bear fruit instantly. Falco Ernst of the International Crisis Group warns that Obrador's refusal to actively curb cartels is a mistake. Now, according to the expert, the state only reacts to the actions of criminals, and the \u201cappetite\u201d of drug cartels is growing with impunity.\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said that under him, the country will no longer \u201chunt cartel leaders\u201d and also promised to focus on the rehabilitation of drug addicts, Mexico City, Mexico, July 11, 2018\nPhoto:\nEPA-EFE/JOSE MENDEZ\nThe failure of the operation to detain Guzman, which seemed to be unauthorized by top management, underscores that the authorities still do not have a clear vision of how to curb the violence right now.\nIn addition, due to US pressure, the new National Guard has focused on stopping the flow of thousands of illegal migrants from Central America instead of replacing soldiers who are ill-equipped to fight crime. The army continues to duplicate police functions. She is accused of torture and other human rights violations.\nThe pressure from the Donald Trump administration increased after the brutal murder by a small cartel in November of nine people with dual US and Mexican citizenship: three women and six children between months and 8 years old.\nTrump called on Mexico to \u201cwage war on drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.\u201d He promised to recognize cartels as terrorist organizations. This allowed US intelligence agencies to operate in Mexico without any approval.\nAnd, according to Arturo Saruhan, former Mexican ambassador to Washington, the US should, first of all, limit the flow of weapons and drug proceeds to Mexico. And also to increase the detection of drugs coming across the southern border.\nThe US should also help Mexico reform its law enforcement system. The police are poorly trained, underfunded and demoralized \u2014 officers buy their own uniforms and even bullets. The judicial system is cumbersome and slow, with only 2% of crimes being punished.\nFamily and friends of the victims from the Bavispe Mormon community say goodbye to their families in La Mora, Sonora, Mexico, November 7, 2019. Three women and six children from one of the oldest Mormon communities were shot dead by drug cartel fighters in their cars on their way to visit relatives in Chihuahua on November 5\nPhoto:\nEPA-EFE/LUIS TORRES\nObrador now blames his predecessors for the disappointing statistics.\nBut with each passing day, his responsibility for the rampant violence is growing, and Mexicans' confidence in the correctness of his policy is falling.\nHowever, the increase in homicides has slowed down slightly in recent months. And raising social standards and introducing scholarships for 2.3 million young Mexicans could eventually have an effect if the economy finally starts to grow.\nIn addition, Garcia Luna, one of the leaders of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, who was arrested in the United States, could uncover corrupt networks at the top of the Mexican authorities that prevent effective action against cartels.\nDrug cartels in Mexico have strengthened their positions: the pandemic makes it more difficult for the authorities to fight them\nThe Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) is a relatively young group that has been active since 2009. Its members are fighting for influence in Guadalajara, Jalisco and Veracruz. The cartel is led by Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, nicknamed \u201cEl Mencho\u201d, one of the most wanted drug lords.\nBy 2018, CJNG had become Mexico's second-strongest cartel.\nIt was he who, as security officers told the agency, is actively using the epidemic to strengthen control over the drug market. The number of murders in the country has increased to record levels, while there are significantly fewer other crimes due to the fact that most residents now stay at home.\nIn recent weeks alone, CJNG militants have kidnapped and killed seven police officers, killed ten hours. a guy at a drug rehab center and shot 12 members of a rival cartel. In its struggle for territory and control of drug supply routes, the cartel faced stiff resistance from other groups.\nThe number of deaths from coronavirus infection in Mexico has exceeded 18,300 people, and the country now has the seventh highest number of deaths in the world. Therefore, the fight against coronavirus is still a priority for the authorities. At the same time, the government does not directly recognize that the epidemic has affected the war against the cartels.\nMexican authorities imposed quarantine restrictions in the country on March 23, when schools, businesses and government agencies were closed. March also saw an increase in the number of murders: about 3,000 were registered in a month. This is one of the highest figures since December 2018.\nNot only doctors and military personnel were involved in the fight against COVID-19: according to the Ministry of Security, at least 4,700 National Guard officers were sent to protect hospitals.\nAt the same time, soldiers who were fighting organized crime were almost paralyzed: to fight the coronavirus, they had to turn their barracks into clinics for the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, according to local officials, there are also problems with the number of police officers: employees at risk (overweight and health problems) have been transferred from patrolling the streets.\nOne of the security officials in Guerrero also spoke about the lack of police. According to him, if one police officer falls ill, four more are quarantined for two weeks.\nGuerrero, like Michoac\u00e1n and Mexico City, is part of the Tierra Caliente (\u201cHot Land\u201d) region in the south-west of the country. Even before the outbreak of the epidemic, it had places where neither troops nor police came. There, criminal groups have much more control.\nIn such places, cartels are partly replacing local authorities and taking over the functions of the state. This is now particularly evident in helping local residents during the pandemic. According to Guerrero residents, paramilitary groups linked to the cartels have imposed curfews in some regions to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\nAccording to Mike Vigil, a former US Drug Enforcement Agency agent, the coronavirus epidemic has only deepened the authorities' problems related to territorial control. In particular, according to him, gaps in power have become more visible. \u201cUnfortunately, drug cartels are filling these gaps,\u201d Vigil summed up.\nCartels clashed with self-defense forces in Mexico\nhttps://ria.\nru/20200118/1563588231.html\nCartels clashed with self-defense forces in Mexico\nCartels clashed with self-defense forces in Mexico\nAuthorities found the bodies of two bodies after the Michoacan Family and the New Generation of Jalisco cartels clashed with local defense forces in western Mexico...

No, I am interested in the pharmacist who is a standardartnomu contentant of the obavilisci of the obavilisci of the obrazheniye of the world, my husband and wife Drugich Prisnakov Prinadlezhnosti k  cartels.\nIn 2020, such content also appeared on Tiktok, according to The New York Times. Leon Oliveira, an anthropologist at the Spanish University of Murcia, who studies Mexican criminal gangs, says: \u201cThis is drug marketing. They use such platforms for propaganda, mostly hedonistic advertising.\u201d\nIn November 2020, US tiktok users noticed a one-minute video of a boat chase in their recommendations. Apparently, it was filmed and published by members of the cartel, and the authorities were chasing them.\nAfter that, the Tiktok algorithm began offering viewers similar videos, and so users got \u201con the side\u201d with the content of the Mexican drug mafia. The video showed expensive cars, bundles of cash, guns, and even tigers as pets. \u201cIt's fascinating to watch a movie,\u201d an 18-year-old California user described Tiktoki.\nIoan Grillo, author of El Narco: Criminal Uprising in Mexico, explains that at first, cartels were violent on the Internet, instilling fear by demonstrating torture. But as social media policies tightened, they began to act differently, showing young Mexicans the benefits of joining a cartel: parties, an endless stream of money, beautiful women, exotic pets.\nIn 2013-2014, American journalists noticed social media accounts under the names of the sons of the famous drug lord El Chapo. Photos of luxury life were posted there, including opulent villas and golden rifles. And in the spring of 2020, British tabloids reported that Jesus Alfredo Guzman, the other son of the head of the Sinaloa cartel, had registered in Tiktok. After publishing several luxury goods videos, his profile was removed.\n\u201cA dream, that's what they sell,\u201d The New York Times interlocutors note.\nPhotos from accounts named El Chapo's sons, 2014\nAt the same time, according to Falco Ernst, an employee of the International Crisis Group, only some tiktoks have been filmed by the main members of the cartels and sicaria (\u201cmurderers\u201d).\nAnd most of the videos are published by \u201clow-level\u201d bandits or just Mexicans who want to live the same way. But, one way or another, the goal of such content is the same: to create a certain image for those who will join the cartel army in the war against law enforcement officers.\nDespite the fact that Mexican cartels have been attracting supporters through social media for many years, Tiktok's peculiarity has slightly changed the principle. \u201cThe post should be short, engaging and viral. Violence becomes entertainment or even part of music,\u201d says Oliveira.\nTikTok deleted many cartel-related videos shortly after The New York Times contacted: service representatives announced a fight against content promoting \u201cillegal activity\u201d. There are a few posts left on Twitter, and the publication described a couple of videos.\nIn one of them, which has half a million likes, a farmer cuts unripe seed pods in a poppy field, presumably to further produce heroin\nJournalists believe that such tiktoks could become another stage in the \u201cglamorization\u201d of the life of a drug cartel member, which allows them to join the ranks. Meanwhile, Mexico recorded a record number of murders in 2019 \u2014 almost 35,000 \u2014 and authorities are waiting for the record to be updated in 2020. \u201cYou can't see this dark reality on Tiktok,\u201d the NYT notes.\nMexican drug fighters are also increasing their presence in Tiktok, where several police bloggers have appeared, covering the everyday life of the war against the cartels.\nItalian mafia\nIn May 2020, a video for local artist Tony Riccio's song \u201cS\u00ec Sto' Carcerato\u201d (\u201cYes, I'm behind bars\u201d) was released on Italian tiktok.\nThe text of the composition described the life of the lyrical hero in prison, and it sounded in the signature \u201cneomelodic\u201d manner typical of Naples.\nAt first glance, this is not unusual if it weren't for the setting in the video: it turned out that he was filmed inside a prison, and not a simple prison, but in the high-security wing of Avellino Prison, 50 kilometers from Naples. Historically, there are criminals associated with the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia. And Tiktok from there probably recorded the life of one of the mobsters.\nVice's Italian editorial staff spent several months studying the traces of the mafia's presence in Tiktok. Journalists came to the conclusion that many young Camorrists (or people who want to be like them) use the service to show off their way of life and \u201cmake themselves known to top management\u201d.\nMafia members gradually began migrating to Tiktok from the more traditional Facebook page.\nOf course, it's impossible to say for sure that the users Vice writers found are related to Camorra. Famous mafiosi in Naples are united in clans, and family ties are important for joining them, but in the modern world this rule is fading into the background. In 2019, the Italian Anti-Mafia Authority talked about the Camorra Academy: young criminals form gangs and act in the interests of the Camorra, and the best of them end up in the family.\nMany camorrists in Tiktok, writes Vice, belong to such gangs. They show cars on video mobiles, motorcycles, weapons and other luxury goods. Paradies is often accompanied by the song \u201cParadies\u201d about life in a \u201charsh neighborhood\u201d.\nYou can also find the hashtag #paranza, which is how Naples calls \u201clittle fish\u201d in the Camorra hierarchy.\nVice also notes other indirect signs that Tiktok users belong to the mafia. For example, an emoji with eyes is the equivalent of the local saying \u201cThose who know the rules of the game are silent\u201d. In another video, the author celebrates his friend's release from prison, calling him \u201cpiazza\u201d \u2014 in slang, this is a place where people sell drugs.\nIn the early 2000s, war broke out in Neapolitan's Scampia district, one of Italy's drug trafficking centers. The Amato-Pagano clan allegedly betrayed the Di Lauro clan, for which the former were named \u201cseparatists\u201d. In response, they nicknamed themselves Gli Spagnoli (\u201cThe Spaniards\u201d), and some of the tiktok videos are signed with Spanish flag emojis.\nOne of them shows a scooter parade on the clan's historic grounds in Scampia.\nThe Italian authorities believe that mafia content on social media is an attempt at a kind of rebranding. Recently, traditional Camorra clans have been trying to retire and divert attention, handing over territories to young gangs. As a result, 19-year-old gang leader Emmanuel Sibillo challenged the local boss, after which he was killed. This attracted \u201cnegative attention\u201d and the clans are now restoring their overall image.\nMarcello Ravveduto, professor of digital history at the University of Salerno, believes that Camorra's arrival in Tiktok makes sense: \u201cWe often forget that criminal organizations and social apps have one thing in common: networks.\u201d\nAnd the more you can see the mafia on Tiktok, the easier it is for them to attract new supporters.\nMexican drug cartel fighters ate a competitor's heart\nhttps://static.news.ru/photo/7a3a876a-e780-11ea-b321-fa163e074e61_660.jpg\nMembers of a drug cartel operating in the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n have resorted to cannibalism to intimidate rival gangs.\nBreitbart drew attention to a shocking episode of the war between criminal gangs. Militants from the Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel released a video of the execution of a member of a rival criminal organization.\nThey held the man on the ground, cut open his chest and took out his heart. The militants involved in the execution then took turns biting off parts of the organ.\nThis bloody incident was the latest in a series of videotaped massacres carried out by gangs vying for power in a region in western Mexico. In Michoac\u00e1n, an alliance of groups known as the United Cartels is at war with the New Generation of Jalisco. Recently, opponents staged a real battle in the city of Tepalcatepec, the capital of the state. The city is considered one of the cartel's key centers for transporting drugs from the coast to other parts of Mexico and to the United States.\nNews.ru previously posted a video showing militants from a Mexican cartel showing off their weapons, equipment and modern equipment.\nAdd our news to favorite sources\nThe Mexican Cartel War: Life on the Battlefield\nA 16-year-old Mexican cousin named Nancy Garcia was picking fruit with his father on a ranch in Michoac\u00e1n when gunmen came and changed his family's lives forever.\nMen kidnapped by drug hitmen are seen at a ranch near the municipality of Sabinas Hidalgo, some 100 km away from Monterrey April 27, 2010 (Reuters/Tomas Bravo).\n\u201cThey came out of nowhere, pointed their guns at my uncle and took my brother,\u201d Nancy told an OCCRP employee.\nThe attack on the Garcia family is just one of the kidnappings for ransom in Michoac\u00e1n, a crime that is becoming increasingly popular here.\nGarcia's family members were desperate and asked for help in every way they could, posting ads and writing posts on Facebook. Two days later, the kidnappers got in touch and announced the amount. The family was able to raise money, but it didn't end there.\n\u201cThe whole family, even my uncle, received calls saying that his daughter had been kidnapped, but it wasn't true. They wanted to intimidate us and get more money,\u201d says Nancy.\nEven relatives in California, where the girl lives, received calls.\n\u201cTo be honest, this situation makes me angry, upset and frightened at the same time. I care about those who live in Michoac\u00e1n. Especially for my family,\u201d says Nancy.\nMigrants who were not released from Mexico under the \u201cStay in Mexico\u201d program (officially known as \u201cMigrant Protection Protocols\u201d) are waiting in line for a bottle of water at a temporary camp in Matamoros, Tamaulipas.

This region is also famous for its marijuana and opium production. This business dates back to the 1960s and has only recently lost to amphetamine and fentanyl.\nFrom time to time, in the hunt for quick money, people kidnap for ransom, as is the case with the Garcia family.\nThis is just one example of PR manifestations of violence and brutality that are increasingly faced by residents of Michoac\u00e1n and Mexico in general.\nThe Mexican president is often criticized for his government's too soft approach to the fight against drug cartels amid the brutality that is sweeping the country.\nAccording to experts, this gentleness plays into the hands of at least one crime boss: Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, better known as El Mencho, is trying to take control of his home state. He is now considered to be the head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.\nNemesio Oseguera Cervantes (photo: US State Department)\nFalco Ernst, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization, told OCCRP that El Mencho considers the area \u201chis rightful\u201d. He has been trying to seize power in the region for the past 8 years.\n\u201cThis is his homeland. This is not a common case of militants seizing territory, it's a matter of personal resentment, Ernst says. \u201cHe was nobody when he left here.\u201d\nErnst doubts that El Mencho will be welcomed with open arms.\nHe spent too much time away from home. His attempts to seize power in the area led to local gangs becoming more active, and some of them joined together as the Michoacan Front to fight back.\nErnst believes that El Mencho significantly killed thirteen police officers on October 14th. He wanted everyone to see it \u2014 the press, locals, and other cartels.\nThe bodies of the police officers were left on the road next to their burnt cars just 12 kilometers from where the drug lord was born.\n\u201cWhat we're seeing now has been happening for several years,\u201d Ernst says. \u201cAnd I think it's not over yet.\u201d\nRelatives of a police officer killed during a cartel attack at a farewell ceremony organized by the state government in Morelia, Michoac\u00e1n on October 15, 2019. (photo: Reuters/Alan Ortega)\nThe US Drug Enforcement Administration calls the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJGN) the most violent cartel in the world \u2014 its list of atrocities is endless.\n\u201cWithout going into details, CJGN has gone from being a major growing drug threat to Mexico's main active drug threat,\u201d Special Agent Kyle Morey told OCCRP.\nThe cartel controls 23 out of 32 Mexican states. Morey adds that they \u201calso control all drug routes to the US and continents other than, perhaps, Antarctica.\u201d\nMori has been investigating the CJGN and El Mencho case for several years. He believes that this is not the first time that the drug lord has returned to Michoac\u00e1n.\n\u201cAs for drug trafficking, I believe CJGN and El Mencho have controlled Michoac\u00e1n for the past six years,\u201d Morey said, adding that he cannot comment on rumors about where El Mencho is.\nThe main question remains: is it possible to put an end to the war between the cartels, and what can the Mexican government do to ensure a normal life for its citizens?\nAt the end of October, Reforma, a Mexican publishing house, conducted a public survey.\n56% of respondents believe that criminals have more power in the country than the government.\nThe survey was conducted against the background of a failed military operation to capture Ovidio Guzman, the son of the famous drug lord El Chapo.\nThe police managed to capture Guzman in Culiac\u00e1n, but were then surrounded by hundreds of armed members of the Sinaloa cartel. Guzman was released and the police had to leave town.\nThe failed operation, followed by a surge in violence in Culiac\u00e1n, led to a storm of anger against the Mexican military and government.\nAccording to Ernst, the government's decision not to fight cartels could lead to irreparable consequences in Michoac\u00e1n. The bandits are checking how far the authorities will allow them to go. And they're not going to stop.\nFor an ordinary resident, being in an area under the control of a cartel or gang is like living in a war zone.\nAny connection to the cartel, no matter how superficial, could cost you your life.\nJenny, an American woman whose family lives in Michoac\u00e1n, says that her two brothers were kidnapped a year ago.\n\u201cOne of the brothers was a member of the cartel,\u201d the girl told OCCRP (the editors do not disclose her last name at her request). \u201cWhen they came for him, he had a brother with him who had nothing in common with these people.\u201d\nBoth of them have been missing ever since.\n\u201cLet's be honest, they're probably dead,\u201d Jenny says.\nexposed: how the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico created a global network to manage the fentanyl trade | World News\nCarlos is a Mexican businessman who works for an import-export company specializing in the sale of tequila and agricultural and chemical products. But in January 2016, he was far from his home in Culiac\u00e1n, the capital of Sinaloa.\nTwo companions accompanied him as he traveled from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Japan, and finally to India.\nThere they met Manu Gupta, a businessman working in various sectors: chemical and pharmaceutical industries, agri-food products, sand and even machinery.\nTwo years later  charges were filed for another aspect of Gupta's business interests. On September 25, 2018, he was arrested in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, along with his Mexican counterpart and an Indian chemist. The three men wore masks and gloves and had more than 10 kilograms of fentanyl, a heavy-duty synthetic opioid.\nGupta and his accomplices are accused of planning to send fentanyl on a commercial flight to Mexico hidden in a suitcase. Three men are currently awaiting trial in India. All three denied the charges.\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 119 journalists have been killed in Mexico since 2000, making Mexico the most dangerous country in the world for members of the press outside the war zone.\nNow 25 international media outlets have come together to continue stories about murdered Mexican colleagues.\nWorking together in 18 different countries for 10 months, the consortium explored the global networks of Mexican drug cartels and their political connections around the world.\nThe collaboration was coordinated by Forbidden Stories, a global network of investigative journalists whose mission is to continue the work of reporters who are threatened, censored, or killed.\nAt the same time, by publishing their stories, the Cartel participants want to send a powerful message to the enemies of the free press: \u201cKilling a journalist won't kill history.\u201d\nAn analysis of social media posts and public information about the company suggests that Carlos (a fictitious name) fits the profile of a person described in a 2019 DEA report as an independent dealer in precursor chemicals.\nThis report, obtained by the international hacker group Anonymous and published in the BlueLeaks document dump in June, states that an unnamed person from Sinaloa was sent to \u201cpurchase additional large quantities of fentanyl precursor chemicals directly from China\u201d on behalf of the cartel.\nCarlos did not respond to Cartel Project's request for an interview.\nThis case sheds light on the international networks set up by Mexican cartels and the business methods they use to dominate the lucrative fentanyl market.\nAs bloodthirsty as they may be, Mexican criminal organizations use the same strategies as any other business: they outsource specialists to maximize profits \u2014 and they are constantly adapting to changing international norms.\nDominant force\nDespite the imprisonment of its best-known leader, Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, the Sinaloa cartel remains the dominant force in the drug trade. An October 2019 Drug Enforcement Administration report describes the group as \u201ca well-known manufacturer and supplier of fentanyl from Mexico to the United States.\u201d\nFentanyl is a synthetic opioid analgesic similar to morphine, but cheaper and 50 to 100 times more powerful.\nFentanyl is increasingly replacing heroin on the clandestine market, causing a record number of overdoses worldwide. In 2018, fentanyl and similar synthetic drugs accounted for nearly half of the 67,367 drug overdose deaths in the U.S. According to the American Medical Association, overdoses rose sharply this year during the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 40 US states reporting increases in drug deaths, especially from synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.\nNot long ago, the mountains of Sinaloa and Guerrero were a patchwork of small plantations where farmers made their living growing marijuana and opium poppies. However, these crops are now being replaced by clandestine laboratories that produce batches of synthetic drugs.\nAt one such lab\u2014just over a few desks in a shrubbery forest near the state capital Culiacan\u2014a cartel chemist and his assistant were working on a new batch of pills.\nBoth men wore white overalls and respiratory masks. The chemist, a burly born man with a master's degree in biochemical engineering, described the industry's transformation when they worked at an outdoor desk.\nFentanyl is a synthetic opioid analgesic similar to morphine but cheaper and much more powerful. Photo: Forbidden Stories\n\u201cFentanyl is more profitable. You only need one tablet per person. So if we transport 10,000 pills, 10,000 people will take them,\u201d he said.\nStirring the white powder with a plastic spatula, he said, \u201cI know my pill is very strong and addictive. And that's what I want. When a consumer takes one and then needs another dose.\u201d\nFentanyl is extremely profitable to produce: where opium poppy requires acres of land and months of care, this very powerful drug requires only minimal manpower and infrastructure. According to a 2019 DEA report, it only costs $1 to produce each fentanyl tablet.\nIt can be resold at least 10 times more in the US.\nNew opportunities\nUntil recently, most of the fentanyl sold in the US came from She is from China, but that has changed with the introduction of stricter international norms in 2017 and China's repression in 2019. Direct transportation of fentanyl has become more risky, but China remains the main producer of the precursor chemical.\nMeanwhile, cartels saw a new opportunity to enter the market as intermediaries.\nThanks to its well-established network, the Sinaloa cartel already had a solid infrastructure to expand the production of synthetic drugs. A memo from the Drug Enforcement Administration, published through BlueLeaks, describes a highly organized network that includes border warehouses and distributors across the United States.\n\u201cThe profit margin they make by synthesizing and processing the product into its consumable form,\u201d explained Falco Ernst, senior analyst for Mexico at the International Crisis Group in Mexico.\nAnd despite cartels' popular image as vertically integrated organizations, they often turn to independent networks to outsource logistics or launder money.\nmap\n\u201cCartel brands are disappearing over time. [But] all these [other] networks are staying in place because they're much less visible. They're much more secretive about their operations. They don't go public and are much more protected from market volatility,\u201d Ernst said.\nOn the other side of the globe, Chinese precursor producers are using similar strategies to avoid getting caught. And as Beijing tightens regulations, some criminal networks are moving some of their businesses to countries with less stringent controls, especially Vietnam and India.\n\u201cThings have changed so drastically\u201d\nIn theory, the sale of precursors is strictly regulated: the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) maintains a \u201cRed List\u201d of restricted substances.\nBut there are almost endless opportunities to bypass these controls by tinkering with chemical compounds to produce new substances that go beyond current regulations.\nTo combat this phenomenon, INCB also maintains an international special checklist of non-scheduled substances, ISSL, to monitor products that are not necessarily controlled substances but are often used illegally.\nHowever, this regulatory system is not perfect: INCB, a non-binding legal entity, relies on companies' goodwill and government audits, which works better in theory than in practice. In fact, a simple Google search reveals the scale of the problem.\nWhen you enter keywords for fentanyl precursors, you quickly get to Pinterest, where Chinese companies exporting fentanyl precursors, many of them to Mexico, post between wedding mood boards and home decor inspiration.\nAt the top of the page is \u201c4-AP,\u201d an ISSL substance that has recently become a controlled substance in the US. According to the DEA, 4-AP has only one purpose: to produce fentanyl.\nUnder the guise of a false Mexican identity, the Cartel project contacted three companies, each offering our secret reporters substances known to be used in the synthesis of opioids.\nOne company offered several 4-AP-like substances that were still available for sale. The supplier suggested using a \u201cspecial line\u201d for shipping to Mexico.\n\u201cWe bought some people at Mexican customs, we trusted them a lot, and they helped with all our deliveries to Mexico. So you don't have to worry about customs,\u201d the seller wrote.\nIn another conversation, the seller explained that one of their \u201cbig\u201d customers in Mexico used cargo planes to deliver precursors. \u201cWhen goods arrived in Mexico, he used his own connections to pick up the goods.\n\u201d\nBryce Pardo, a researcher at the Rand Corporation who specializes in drug policy, said that current legislation is simply out of step with today's drug market.\n\u201cOur drug control laws are based on a very old system, where everything is based on a single UN convention from 1961. They actually focused on three plants: cannabis, coke, and maca. The situation has changed so much in the past 10-15 years, since China actually got online with its pharmaceutical sector \u2014 to the point that we just can't keep up.\u201d\nMore information from Fran\u00e7ois Ruchti (RTS), Sandhya Ravishankar (The Lede), Michael Standard (South China Morning Post), and Michael Lohm\u00fcller (C4ADS)\nCartel methamphetamine, Mexico's once-murderous peaceful state\nMEXICO (AP) \u2014 In the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, the color of methamphetamine or the label on the packaging in an addict's pocket can determine whether he will survive or die.\nThe Jalisco cartel sells crystal clear methamphetamine for $2.30 per dose. Santa Rosa de Lima's house gang sells cheaper blue methamphetamines for $1.40 . And rival gangs don't accept the competition for control that has turned Guanajuato into one of Mexico's most blood-drenched states.\n\u201cThis is the right death sentence\u201d if a dealer is caught with the wrong color of methamphetamine, said David Sosedo, a security analyst at Guanajuato. \u201cIt's almost like a scenario... mass murders of street vendors. They will attack a funeral where a relative (of the deceased) had some connections to another gang.\u201d\nIt is unclear whether individual colors are the result of different production processes or whether colors are intentional. It may not be a coincidence that the recently arrested Santa Rosa gang leader has been nicknamed El Azul, or \u201cBlue.\u201d\nBoth sides also label plasticine envelopes with their own stamps. Jalisco might say \u201cCJNG,\u201d the band's initials, or \u201cGrupo Elite,\u201d or have a skull pattern with a bayonet and gun.\nSanta Rosa's symbol is a triangle with a skull and two sledgehammers, a reference to the nickname of another arrested leader.\nSophia Hutt, Guanajuato's security commissioner, said these markings could make the most difference. \u201cThis is a brand concept based on a label rather than a color that is not always present.\u201d\nIn any case, the battle now pits two of the most powerful drug cartels in the hemisphere against each other for control of the state \u2014 an industrial and agricultural center that attracts gangs for the same reason as automakers: road and rail networks that lead directly to the U.S. border.\nConcerned about the rise of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the long-powerful Sinaloa Cartel has allied itself with Santa Rosa de Lima and other small local groups in recent months.\nGuanajuato, Mexico's sixth most populous state, was home to more than 3,400 homicides in the first nine months of this year, more than any other state in the country.\nMore police officers died in the line of duty here than in any other Mexican state.\nThe battle has come to resemble Prohibition-era Chicago, when gunmen shoot houses or stores that compete with drug trafficking or other smuggling.\n\u201cThis type of mass murder takes place in places that sell drugs or stolen fuel,\u201d Sosedo said. \u201cThey'll go into a store, a warehouse, a tire repair shop and kill everyone, destroy the place, throw a hand grenade.\u201d\nThe Santa Rosa de Lima gang expanded to drugs after it began robbing freight trains and stealing fuel from government pipelines, an activity that drew particular attention from a government furious at the loss of revenue.\nWhen police approached him in July, Santa Rosa cartel leader Jose Antonio Yepez Ortiz, known as \u201cEl Marro\u201d or \u201cThe Sledgehammer,\u201d made a desperate call for an alliance with the Sinaloa cartel to repel Jalisco's group.\nis currently Mexico's fastest growing and most violent criminal organization.\nJalisco has already traveled to at least 20 states, sometimes posting online videos showing columns of heavily armed militants with makeshift armored vehicles, and making vague and often broken promises not to kidnap or extort protection payments from civilians.\nSaucedo said that the Sinaloa gang did not want to support Santa Rosa, whose leaders were considered unsophisticated and unreliable gangsters. But \u201cEl Marro's arrest caused the Sinaloa cartel to intervene in Guanajuato to prevent Jalisco from taking control.\u201d\n\u201cWe had a war between two cartels, and unfortunately a third cartel (Sinaloa) is now in conflict.\u201d\nHuett, the State Security Commissioner, said Santa Rosa and other local gangs are providing the larger outside group with \u201cfirepower, manpower, even with seasoned criminals, murderers to stand up to Jalisco's organization to curb their expansion a little bit.\nHe also sends weapons and money, as well as his operatives. According to her, 10 militants from Sinaloa have been captured this month.\nThis would be true for the Sinaloa scenario. In the early 2000s, Sinaloa fought the Juarez cartel for the lucrative border city of Ciudad Juarez, supporting local gangs like Artistas Asesinos and Mexicles against the armed branches of Juarez, La Linea, and Barrio Azteca. These four gangs turned Ciudad Juarez, near El Paso, Texas, into a homicide field between 2008 and 2012.\nIn Guanajuato, murders have reached similar proportions.\nIn July, cartel fighters killed 26 people at an unregistered drug rehabilitation center in Irapuato. The attackers shot every man in the center, allowing only women to enter.\nAt the end of September, gunmen killed 11 people, including four women, at a bar in Jaral del Progreso. Five more people in this city died earlier this month in a shootout at a funeral.\nThe Jalisco cartel began slaughtering up competing dealers and carefully piling their severed limbs together to support their severed heads, sometimes with a surprised expression, sweat because the victims' eyelids were cut off.\nThe Mexican Sinaloa cartel, specializing in fentanyl for supply to the US market\n- The powerful Sinaloa cartel built an empire by smuggling cocaine through Mexico to the US.\n- But the cartel is shifting its focus to a new, stronger drug to keep up with US changing appetites.\n- At a lab in downtown Sinaloa, cartel members told Insider how they're working to keep drug users in the US.\n- Visit the Insider business section to learn more.\nCuliac\u00e1n, MEXICO \u2014 Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel has built an empire on cocaine, but in response to changing US demand, it's shifting its focus to a newer, more powerful drug.\nWhile the cartel, known for its jailed thief in law Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, is still a major US cocaine distributor, the organization is betting on fentanyl to meet demand for opioids north of the border while maintaining the cartel in Mexico.\nFentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid analgesic similar to morphine, but 50 to 100 times more powerful, according to US authorities. Mexican drug cartels are adding fentanyl to heroin to increase its effectiveness and market value.\nDuring a recent trip to Sinaloa, on Mexico's Pacific coast, Insider gained access to a fentanyl lab run by the Sinaloa cartel.\nThe lab was a rudimentary makeshift tent a couple of hours from Culiac\u00e1n, the capital of Sinaloa. The setup included a huge pot, a makeshift press, and some lab tools. To get there, it took a highway ride, switching from a car to an off-road pickup truck, and a short walk through a dry forest.\nSinaloa police officers at a clandestine synthetic drug lab in Carrizalejo, Sinaloa, Mexico, July 6, 2018.\nRASHID FRIAS/AFP via Getty Images\nThere were five people in the lab: a cook, three assistants, and an armed sentinel in charge of two-way radio communications.\nEveryone was wearing green camouflage uniforms.\nThey've been running fentanyl and heroin labs since 2019, when the cartel decided to leave marijuana crops and poppy fields aside to meet new demand.\n\u201cOur customer base on the other side [of the border] doesn't want this old black chiva anymore,\u201d said the cartel member responsible for the illegal lab, referring to Mexican black tar heroin.\nU.S. drug users are \u201cused to fentanyl-enhanced heavy-duty heroin,\u201d the participant added.\nAccording to him, users in the US started asking for fentanyl-enhanced heroin in 2015, but they didn't receive the order and recipes for its preparation until 2019.\n\u201cThe cook learned from a Chinese man and brought everything useful here as a \u201ccartel\u201d. \u201cHe's the only one who knows the recipe,\u201d a cartel member told Insider.\n\u201cBut a lot of people started to die because we still didn't have the right recipe, and some of them didn't know about the effectiveness of the new product,\u201d he added.\nA Sinaloa police officer at a clandestine synthetic drug lab in Carrizalejo, Sinaloa, July 6, 2018.\nRASHID FRIAS/AFP via Getty Images\nOne of those victims was Landon Marsh, the youngest son of Arizona Senator Christine Marsh.\n\u201cHe bought a street drug mixed with fentanyl and it killed him,\u201d said Marsh, who is now fighting fentanyl in Arizona, defending the use of fentanyl test strips.\n\u201cOur country is faced with an opioid crisis. We've lost 8,140 lives since June 2017, and fentanyl-supplemented drugs are a significant factor in this crisis,\u201d Marsh told Insider.\nMore than 30,000 people in the U.S. overdosed on fentanyl in 2018, making it one of the deadliest illegal drugs in history, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIt was this strategy \u2014 mixing heroin with fentanyl \u2014 that made the Sinaloa cartel a leading player in a relatively new business.\nA leaked DEA report from 2019 called the cartel \u201ca well-known fentanyl producer and trader from Mexico to the US.\u201d\nA chemical specialist wearing a protective suit with pills seized at a clandestine laboratory to detect fentanyl in Mexico City, December 12, 2018.\nAttorney General's Office/Handout via REUTERS\nMexican authorities reported a 466% increase in fentanyl seizures in 2020, amounting to about 2,400 pounds (1,301 kilograms), compared to 405 pounds (222 kg) in 2019, according to the Mexican Ministry of Defense.\n\u201cWe have arrested 175 illegal fentanyl laboratories, which is 92% more than in 2019,\u201d Mexican Defense Secretary Luis Crecencio Sandoval said at a recent press conference. Sandoval said 76% of the labs discovered last year were outdoors, such as the one in Culiac\u00e1n.\nBut the Mexican cartels quickly adapted.\n\u201cWe stopped using large reputable labs because the [Mexican] government started with or hit us. A few weeks ago, the military raided this laboratory, but we received a warning about the operation and left with all the valuable material, said a cartel observer.\nAccording to the cook, most of the chemicals used in operations are illegally imported from China and Germany.

It was 8:30 a.m. when they surrounded a police station in this rural town. Bullets clashed after blocks. By the time the security forces arrived, Ricardo Barron Guzman was already dead, and the second chief of police was shot dead here in 14 months.\nSurrounded by beans and corn fields in Zacatecas, this sleepy city of 13,000 people was once known for the heroes it brought to the Mexican Revolution and the migrants it sent to the United States. The assassination of the police chief in September reflected his new notoriety: Juan Aldama became another front in Mexico's increasingly difficult fight for control of the territory.\nThis month's arrest of Mexico's former defense minister stunned the nation as US prosecutors claimed he helped the cartel ship thousands of kilograms of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine to the United States.\nBut Mexico's crisis goes far beyond the occasional failures that make headlines.\nPress Enter to go to the end of the carousel.\nLOSING CONTROL: How criminal groups are changing Mexico\nCarousel \u2014 $ LOSE CONTROL: How criminal groups are changing Mexico: use tabs or arrows to navigate.\nThe end of the carousel\nThis was once the name of organized crime. A handful of cartels deliver drugs along highways to the United States. As a result of a fundamental shift, today's criminals are infiltrating deeper into the country, infiltrating communities, police forces, and town halls. The vast range of armed groups \u2014 perhaps more than 200 \u2014 has evolved into a broader range of activities. They not only transport drugs, but they also kidnap Mexicans, take migrants out and turn their businesses from lime producers to mining companies.\n\u201cZacatecas is in the hands of criminals,\u201d said a schoolteacher who heard about the attack on Barron Guzman and who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\u201cThe state government is not in control of the situation.\u201d\nBullet holes pierce a house and grocery store in Juan Aldama after the attack.\nIt's easy not to notice how much the criminal threat in the country has grown. Mexico is the United States' No. 1 trading partner, a country of bustling factories and quiet beach resorts. But despite 14 years of military operations and $3 billion in US anti-drug assistance, criminal organizations are transforming the Mexican landscape:\n- In a secret study conducted in 2018 but not previously published, CIA analysts concluded that drug trafficking groups had gained effective control over about 20 percent of Mexico, according to several current and former U.S. officials.\n- The homicide rate has skyrocketed in the past two years to its highest level in six decades; 2020 is approaching another record. Mexico's homicide rate is more than four times higher than that of the United States.\n- Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes to escape violence; the Mexican Congress is ready to pass the country's first law to help internally displaced persons.\n- More than 77,000 people are missing, authorities said this year, far more than previous governments have admitted. This is the greatest crisis of its kind in Latin America since the \u201cdirty wars\u201d of the 1970s and 1980s.\n- The State Department is urging Americans to avoid traveling to half of Mexico's states, marking five of them as danger level 4 \u2014 the same as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.\nThe Mexican government has denied losing control of any part of the country. But in a little-known passage from his security plan last year, he compared rebel criminal groups with \u201ca level of organization, firepower, and territorial control comparable to what armed political groups had elsewhere.\u201d\nPresident Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lopez Obrador created a 100,000 strong National Guard to recover territories with little state presence. It's not clear what's going to change. Years of Mexican and American strategy \u2014 arresting drug lords, training Mexican police, rebuilding the justice system \u2014 have failed to stop the violence.\nTo describe the crisis, politicians have turned to the language of armed conflict. When nine dual US and Mexican citizens were killed in Sonora last year, President Trump called on the United States to help Mexico \u201cfight its WAR on drug cartels.\u201d\n[How the cartel wars in Mexico destroyed the peaceful but dangerous existence of American Mormons]\nBut the arrest of the ex his Mexican defense minister in Los Angeles this month illustrates the complexity of the situation. Federal prosecutors say General Salvador Cienfuegos collected bribes from the H-2 cartel based in Nayarit.\n\u201cToday we don't have an insurgent group in Mexico that says, 'We're going to overthrow the state, '\u201d said Romain Le Court, co-founder of Noria Research, which studies violence and political systems. \u201cThere are very, very violent groups in Mexico that are somehow collaborating with the system because they need the system to really survive and thrive.\u201d\nThe struggle for territorial control looks different in different parts of Mexico.\nThe northwestern state of Sinaloa, formerly owned by Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, was dominated by a single cartel for many years. Even though the drug lord is in an American prison, the group is holding tight: when the military tried to arrest Guzman's son Ovidio last year, numerous militants besieged the state capital and the authorities released him.\nAccording to Falco Ernst, senior Mexico analyst at the International Crisis Group, in Guerrero, a state roughly the size of West Virginia, at least 40 armed groups are fighting for dominance in cities and businesses ranging from heroin to logging. The situation illustrates the extreme fragmentation of organized crime in some areas.\nZacatecas is an example of a third way. At first glance, the situation seems peaceful. It is dotted with farms and ghost villages, mostly abandoned by migrants in the U.S. The state capital, also called Zacatecas, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is famous for its charming Spanish colonial square and pink stone cathedral.\nAn empty house in Ojo de Agua, a farming community in Zacatecas.

But in many places they have been outarmed or intimidated. One day this year, for example, a column of 60 heavily armed men in white pickup trucks roared into Valparaiso's central square. \u201cThe Jalisco Cartel!\u201d some shouted, as can be heard on video on social media. Mayor Eleuterio Ramos Leal said only about 15 police officers were on duty. He told The Washington Post that challenging the militants \u201ccould end in a massacre.\u201d\nIt's not that drug cartels were the first to appear in Zacatecas. For many years, they've been transporting marijuana and cocaine along roads to the US border. Now the fight \u201cis not about control of the route,\u201d said Ismael Camberos, who until recently served as head of state security forces. \u201cThis is control over the territory to engage in all types of illegal activities.\u201d\nFour cartels are fighting for control of fentanyl routes through Zacatecas, while small groups rob and extort money from ordinary Mexicans. In northern Zacatecas, where Juan Aldama is located, a faction of the Sinaloa cartel led by Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambad entered. Militants were seen riding pickups freely around the area, with the inscription \u201cMZ\u201d on their helmets or assault rifles.\nAccording to Governor Alejandro Tello, criminals threatened more than half of the state's mayors. Gangsters often \u201cforce\u201d local officials to cooperate, said Alma Gloria Davila, a state deputy.\n\u201cThey lock them in the back of a car, carry them, torture them for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then they threaten their families.\u201d\nBut it's not just that armed groups are intimidating authorities. In many communities, cartels have taken over the government from within.\nThere is no better example than Nayarit. From the elegant five-star resorts of Punta Mita to the trendy surf village of Sayulita, the Pacific coast state attracts Americans.\nBut far from beautiful beaches, the Sinaloa and H-2 cartels have been fighting for years.\nEdgar Veitia brought peace.\nThe state attorney general was exactly like a penny of a Mexican lawyer with a round chin and a thick mustache, with a gun stuck behind his belt. He said that \u201corganized crime has no place in Nayarit.\u201d In four years, homicides have fallen by 75 per cent.\nIn fact, Veitia just chose a side. According to US prosecutors, the H-2 gang paid him monthly bribes. In return, Veitia used his corrupt state police to protect shipments of heroin, cocaine, and other cartel drugs.\nAccording to prosecutors, its officers wiretapped, arrested and even killed the gang's rivals.\nVeitia pleaded guilty last year to drug charges in New York. The case drew little attention as it was overshadowed by the controversial El Chapo Guzman trial in the same Brooklyn courthouse. But the news of Cienfuegos's arrest this month comes again drew attention to Nayarit. The H-2 didn't just bribe the state's top lawyer; it allegedly corrupted the head of the Mexican army. (Cienfuegos did not plead guilty.)\nAn image of Edgar Veitia on the phone of a man whose son disappeared in Nayarit. US prosecutors say Veitia took monthly bribes from the cartel when he was Attorney General.\nOf course, drug corruption has a long history in Mexico. During decades of authoritarian rule, top federal officials quietly echoed the cartels. State and local governments took turns taking bribes to ignore how heroin or marijuana flowed through their states.\nMexico's democratization changed the equation. Local governments are now more autonomous. Criminal groups are increasingly seeking influence at the municipal and state levels through threats or bribery.\nThe country's fragile justice system has been unable to control such bribery.\n[Former Mexican drug enforcement official accused of taking bribes from the El Chapo Cartel]\nThe criminals got the message, said Cecilia Farfan-Mendez, a Mexican security expert at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cImpunity makes you feel like you can do what you want to do.\u201d\nMexico's security crisis has arisen in part because of the very efforts to crush cartels.\nAs part of the US-backed thief in law strategy, Mexican forces killed or captured the leaders of several powerful groups: the Zeta cartels, Beltran Leyva, Juarez, and Arellano Felix. But this approach not only did not put them out of business, but also made them split.\nThe Mexican government currently recognizes 19 \u201cpowerful\u201d criminal groups, including two with a national reach: the New Generation of Jalisco and the Federation of Sinaloa. The International Crisis Group has identified 198 cartels, gangs and regional groups, many of which are subcontractors to larger players. Eduardo Guerrero, head of security firm Lantia Consultores, has 231.\nSmaller groups \u201cno longer have the infrastructure needed to export drugs,\u201d Guerrero said. So they're aimed at Mexicans. They steal, extort, steal fuel, sell contraband cigarettes, and sell methamphetamine to teenagers. The big cartels have also expanded to such predatory activity as to pay their increasingly heavily armed paramilitary units.\n\u201cThey need territorial control not only to transport drugs, but also to extract resources from the population,\u201d said Ricardo Marquez, a former senior Mexican security official.\n[Jalisco's next-generation cartel in Mexico paves a bloody path to power]\nThe drug trade has also diversified. In addition to producing heroin and marijuana, criminal groups produce methamphetamine in \u201csuper labs\u201d and press fentanyl in pills. This requires territorial control. \u201cThey need more land to hide and disguise these labs,\u201d said a senior U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss current issues.\nCriminal groups have also increased their social control. Davila says her hometown of Tacoaleche is symbolic.\nAlma Gloria Davila, an MP in Zacatecas, says criminal groups often \u201cforce\u201d local officials to collaborate with them, sometimes abducting them or threatening their families.\n\u201cIt was all about the dream of a pickup truck,\u201d the MP said. Preferably Chevy Cheyenne. It's that migrants who were successful in the United States went home to a city of 12,000 near the state capital.\nMore than a decade ago, Davila says, Zetas cartel fighters started showing up in trendy pickups. Several local families had money \u2014 cattle, bean farms, shops. But many young people thought they had only two options.\n\u201cThey could either become a migrant and come back in their pickup truck,\u201d Davila said, \u201cor they could get a pickup truck because they were criminals.\u201d\nThe young people signed up in search of the Zetas \u2014 and provided information about who to kidnap. Davila pointed to some victims: dairy farm workers. Store owners. Farmers.\nAfter the government killed or arrested most of the Zeta leaders, local boys switched to other criminal groups or started their own. A similar picture took place elsewhere.\nPick-up at the municipality of Zacatecas in Guadalupe Province, where Davila's hometown is located.\nDavila gives advice to two people after someone breaks into their house.\nA man in Guadeloupe sells police equipment from his pickup truck. Violence in the area has increased as cartels fight for control of fentanyl transportation routes.\n\u201cUnfortunately, young people have become an army of reservists for organized crime,\u201d The Post told The Post  Alfonso Durazo, Director of Public Security in Mexico. Lopez Obrador is so concerned that he has launched a vocational training program for more than 2 million young people.\nMexico has failed to stop the violence for various reasons. According to analysts and former officials, the government and its allies in Washington have sometimes misunderstood the problem.\nRoberta Jacobson, U.S.'s ambassador to Mexico from 2016 to 2018, said that the country's cartels are much more complex than authorities originally thought \u2014 more like multinationals than criminal groups. Removing leaders was not enough to destroy them.\n\u201cWe and Mexicans spent too little time on the entire corporate structure,\u201d including financing and transportation systems, said Jacobson, who was the State Department's top Latin American official from 2012 to 2016.\n[Five reasons Mexico opposes Trump's plan to label his cartels as terrorist groups]\nThere was a second miscalculation: the belief that decapitating cartels would split them into gangs that the local police could handle. \u201cThe problem is that Mexico doesn't have the capacity at the state or municipal level\u201d to fight crime, said Eric Olson, a researcher at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington.\nAnd groups were often heavily armed and funded by local criminal activity: kidnappings, extortion, prostitution, migrant smuggling. Authorities \u201ccan't come to terms with these organizations, which are pretty much mini-armies,\u201d said Stephen Dudley, co-director of research group InSight Crime.\nMexico has failed to transform the justice system created to serve authoritarian governments during decades of one-party rule. The police are poorly trained and equipped. There are no prosecutors, forensic experts and accountability mechanisms. The result? According to the civic group Zero Impunity, only 1.3 percent of crimes in Mexico are solved and reported.\n\u201cYou must begin the process of rebuilding the entire security and justice chain in the country,\u201d said Guillermo Valdes Castellanos, former head of Mexico's national intelligence agency CISEN. According to his estimates, this could take a generation and require tripling the budget for security and justice.\nAlthough Mexico has increased its spending in these areas, it still accounts for only about 1 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, much less than in most industrialized countries. \u201cPoliticians don't care,\u201d Valdes Castellanos said. \u201cThey don't understand that this is a problem and that institutions need to be redesigned to solve it.\u201d\nThe US government has provided $3 billion in aid since 2007 under the Merida Initiative. In recent years, he has focused on institution building, including police training and supporting the restructuring of the Mexican legal system.\n\u201cBut this is not due to the process of integrated reform\u201d led by the Mexican government, said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst based in Mexico City. And many Mexicans say the United States has not done enough to reduce American demand for drugs or to stop the flow of illegal firearms across the border.\nShortly before Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018, the CIA concluded that drug groups controlled about 20 percent of Mexican territory, according to several current and former officials who spoke on condition of anonymity about the classified document. The agency declined to comment. Such studies are unusual; while the US government regularly maps the locations of rebels in places like Colombia and Afghanistan, it is harder to assess criminals' quiet control over local economies and political systems.\nLopez Obrador focuses on social programs aimed at combating poverty, which is the root cause of crime. Abrazos no balazos, he says: hugs, not bullets. At the same time, he relied heavily on the military to respond to violence, as well as the new National Guard, which had received military training.\nDurazo, chief of public safety, notes that there are three times as many guards as the now dissolved federal police. \u201cI don't think it's possible to talk anymore about regions of the country where there is no state,\u201d Durazo said. (This month, Durazo announced he was resigning to run for governor of Sonora.)\nAnd there have been some successes. Lopez Obrador's government has drastically reduced theft from oil pipelines, and car thefts have fallen by almost 40 percent. The Treasury Department has frozen about $525 million in suspicious bank accounts this year, twice as much as in all of 2019.\nBut murders that have already reached historic highs, etc. borrowed to grow this year despite the coronavirus outbreak in the country. Extortion has also increased. US agents say Mexico's drug trade is booming. \u201cWe've never seen Mexico produce this much methamphetamine,\u201d said a senior DEA official.\nThe massive flow of drugs to the United States is just one of the consequences of Mexico losing control over parts of its territory. The other is displacement.\nBrandon, 9, is petting his family dog on the roof of his home in Juan Aldam. His mother, Consuelo, has been concerned about the chaos in the city in recent years.\nConsuelo, 35, and her three children are sitting in their bedroom. The family tried to flee to the United States to escape danger in their city.\nConsuelo's youngest son is playing with a curtain in their house.\nConsuelo, 35, a full-time mother of three, has become concerned in recent years about the chaos in Juan Aldama.\nThere have been robberies, disappearances, and street drug dealing in their neighborhood. Then one night in July 2019, gunmen ambushed and killed the chief of police. Officers have disappeared from the streets.\n\u201cMy husband told me: 'We must get out of here, '\u201d she said, provided that her last name would not be disclosed out of concern for her safety. \u201cHe said to me, 'Can't you see there's no police? Can't you see they're scared? Who's going to protect us? \u201d\nShe heard that the United States was offering asylum to Mexicans at risk. The family stuffed their clothes into their backpacks and boarded a bus to take the 600-mile ride to the Texas border.\nFrancisco Javier Adame watched the increasing exodus from the nearby village of Ojitos. Some people were quitting low-paying jobs, said Adam, a senior official in the city. But many fled from local rings to kidnap people.\n\u201cLook, we don't have anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey'll decapitate you if you don't pay.\u201d\nAccording to researchers at the University of California at San Diego and the University of Texas, by November last year, more than 11,000 Mexican asylum seekers had crossed the border. US officials had never seen anything like it. But far from expanding the asylum system, the US government has tightened it. Many applicants had to wait in Mexico. Consuelo's family is back home.\nThe number of Mexicans seeking asylum abroad has slowed this year as the Trump administration effectively halted the process during the pandemic. But the pause may be temporary.\nResidents of Juan Aldama were amazed by the news last month that another police chief had been shot dead. Barron Guzman had only been at work for a month.\n\u201cI think people will keep leaving,\u201d Consuelo said.\nA more serious displacement crisis is taking place in Mexico. In some states, like Guerrero, entire communities were deserted as armed groups approached.\nIn March, for example, militants forced 800 people to leave their homes in three villages in Leonardo Bravo's municipality.\nIn many other places, residents are leaving quietly, one family at a time.\nThe state statistical agency estimates that more than 1.In 2018, 7 million Mexicans fled crime, the highest number in nine years, according to surveys. Congress is expected to soon approve Mexico's first aid law for displaced persons, reflecting the growing efforts of civic groups and some officials to shed light on the huge losses caused by Mexico's security crisis.\nIn Nayarit, scores of people expressed their suffering to the \u201ctruth commission\u201d set up by activists to document violations during Veitia's rule. Residents accuse him of using threats and imprisonment to force citizens to hand over property. Mothers demanding justice are protesting in front of the Attorney General's building, putting up photos of their children, who they say have disappeared by the Veitia police wearing masks.\n\u201cThe criminal group has taken over the institutions of Nayarit for six years,\u201d said Rodrigo Gonz\u00e1lez Barrios, a spokesman for the truth commission.\nVeitia is serving a 20-year sentence; former Governor Roberto Sandoval has been sanctioned by the US government for allegedly taking bribes from drug traffickers. (He denied wrongdoing).\nThe besieged residents of Nayarit thought the picture couldn't be darker. Then the country's former defense chief was arrested.\nAccording to Gonz\u00e1lez Barrios, drug corruption seems to have reached the very top. \u201cWho can we believe in?\u201d\nPrickly branches block the entrance to an abandoned building in Jerez, Zacatecas.\nGreg Miller contributed to this report.\nThe drug cartel destroys enemies with bomber drones\nThese officers, who all shouted the nickname of their main boss, Nemesio \u201cEl Mencho\u201d by Oseguer Cervantes, throughout the footage, reportedly belong to a \u201cspecial forces\u201d contingent in the cartel's overall force structure.\nThis video follows CJNG's failed assassination attempt on Mexico City Police Chief Omar Garcia  Harfuha in June. Harfuch was injured in a shootout and two of his bodyguards were killed.\nCJNG's growing resources are also reflected in its new air capabilities. In April, it was reported that CJNG dropped improvised explosive devices from small conventional manned aircraft during attacks on members of the Tepalcatepec self-defense militia. The cartel apparently quickly abandoned this tactic after Mexican authorities increased aerial surveillance of the region and have since switched to using miniature drones.\nQuadcopters carrying explosives, allegedly owned by CJNG, were also discovered in April in Puebla in the homonymous state southeast of Mexico City. Mexican officials said they believed they were designed to attack the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel in the northwest state of Guanajuato. The discovery of these drones led to raids that found more quadcopters, as well as various electronics and bomb-making materials, including even more C4s.\nIt is not at all surprising that the CJNG, in particular, has turned to small unmanned systems as a means to carry out various campaigns of violence across Mexico. Mexican cartels, among other criminal groups, are already using them to carry drugs over walls and other obstacles, as well as for surveillance. At least since 2017, there have been more frequent reports that other cartels used small drones with explosives.\nThe barrier to entry when it comes to building small ATVs with bombs and hexcopter-type drones is generally particularly low. This is something that the War Zone has repeatedly emphasized in the past, which makes this concept particularly attractive to non-state actors.\nIn 2018, a group opposed to Venezuela's dictatorial President Nicolas Maduro tried to assassinate him at a public rally using a commercially available multi-rotor drone system. This comes years after ISIS terrorists largely brought this concept to the real battlefield in Iraq.\nSince then, small drones with various types of homemade munitions have been steadily spreading among terrorists and other armed groups in Iraq and Syria. The Russian Syrian post at the Khmeimim airbase has been regularly attacked by drones since 2018.\nIn July, authorities in the Iraqi capital Baghdad discovered an unmanned quadcopter with a very specific-looking bomb underneath it in a neighboring area near the heavily fortified Green Zone, where various government buildings and embassies, including the United States, are located. Iranian-backed militias often use these surrounding areas to launch rockets at the U.S. Embassy compound.\nThese are just a few of the easily accessible examples of this tactic being used. In fact, when it comes to the dangers of using drones to kill criminal gangs, Japanese authorities warned back in 2015 that Yakuza families are doing exactly what CJNG is currently doing in Mexico.\nEven larger nation-state militaries are starting to use the relative simplicity of these drone quadcopters as a starting point for more sophisticated weapon systems, including designs that can work together in autonomous swarms. Turkey is now launching the drone system you're all reading about here.\nThis reality has made the United States, among others, struggle to catch up when it comes to developing countermeasures. The US military is generally exploring a wide range of different anti-drone technologies to combat these lower-level threats, ranging from jammers to directed-energy weapons, including both lasers and high-power microwaves.\n\u201cI keep arguing with my Air Force friends that the future of flying is vertical and unmanned,\u201d said W., US Central Command chief General Kenneth McKenzie said at a public event in June.\n\u201cI'm not talking about large unmanned platforms the size of a regular fighter plane that we can see and work with like any other platform. I'm talking about one you can go and buy at Costco right now in the United States for a thousand dollars, four ATVs, a rotorcraft or something like that you can launch and fly,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd with very simple modifications, you can turn it into something that can drop a weapon, like a hand grenade or something else. \u201cRecent activities\nCJNG only emphasizes that there is a serious need for countermeasures outside the battlefield to protect VIPs, critical infrastructure and much more from espionage and potentially dangerous harassment, as well as intentional lethal attacks. The need for any mobile equipment The fight against unmanned aerial vehicles as an \u201cemerging requirement\u201d just this week.\nIf this cartel successfully adds small armed drones to its already significant arsenal and shows that they can be useful on a more regular basis, it could easily lead to the explosion of other criminal groups in the country and abroad that are also using this tactic.\nContact the author: [email protected]\nFrom drones with bombs to drug banks: Mexican cartels\n, article\nA forensic examination is exhuming human remains found in Huitzuco de los Figueroa, Guerrero, Mexico. (Photo from Pedro PARDO/AFP archive via Getty Images)\nNEW YORK \u2014 Mexico's increasingly militarized crackdown on powerful drug cartels has left nearly 39,000 unidentified bodies languishing in the country's morgues, a grotesque symbol of the ongoing drug war and rampant violence.\nQuinto Elemento Labs, an investigative NGO, found in a recent report that an alarming number of people were simply buried in mass graves without proper autopsies, while others stayed in funeral homes.\nThe so-called war on drugs has taken the lives of almost 300,000 people in the past 14 years, and another 73,000 are missing.\nAt the same time, these cartels have yet to be recognized as official terrorist organizations, despite the fact that they boast well-documented arsenals of sophisticated weaponry to compete with most feared militias on battlefields abroad.\nJust last month, reports surfaced that Mexico's next-generation Jalisco cartel (CJNG) now owns bomb-carrying drones that The Drive combat zone describes as \u201csmall drones like quadcopters carrying small explosive devices to attack enemies.\u201d\n\u201cMexican cartels operate like a sophisticated terrorist group and use sophisticated weapons to kill and intimidate. They use military-grade weapons and pose a serious threat to US national security,\u201d Derek Maltz, former Drug Enforcement Agent (DEA) Chief of Special Operations, told Fox News. \u201cAs Mexican cartels expand around the world and increase their revenues, they use the latest and greatest technologies and buy better weapons.\u201d\nAt the end of July, two dozen explosive-laden quadcopters were reportedly removed from a cartel car in Michoac\u00e1n. Container-like bombs filled with C4 charges and ball bearings that functioned like shrapnel stuck to the drones.\nWhile cartels have previously used air assets to distribute drugs through border barriers and surveillance, recent discoveries have raised deeper questions about their combat tactics.\n\u201cBetween 2012 and 2017, Mexican cartels made 850 incursions into the United States using drones,\u201d said Lee Houghton, co-founder and COO of Mexico's Fortress Risk Management, citing government data and intelligence collection. \u201cFor the most part, the Sinaloa, Los Zetas and Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartels have surpassed the Mexican and US authorities with their drone fleet.\u201d\nSince 2014, according to a Robotics Business Review report, Mexican cartels have learned how to create and use drones for their criminal activities, explaining this by the fact that a drone can carry more than 220 pounds of cocaine. Thus, using drones reduces the risks and costs of drug trafficking.\nIn addition to the advancing air arsenal, the stockpile of ground weapons is expanding and improving.\nIn a disastrous and hours-long clash between Mexican police and the infamous Sinaloa cartel over the arrest of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman's son, the cartel fighters fought back using Barrett 50-caliber anti-tank rifles, a staggering 50-caliber. M2 machine guns were hoisted onto trucks carrying guns, and at least one vehicle with a \u201cmakeshift armored turret in the back\u201d was considered \u201cdrug tanks\u201d in scenes that reflected the urban combat jungles of Mosul rather than Mexico.\nEarlier this month, Mexican authorities also tweeted images of a makeshift tank they dug up while patrolling the rural plains of San Jose de Chila, just west of Mexico City.\n\u201c#GuardiaNacional staff found a van with homemade armor allegedly used by a criminal gang in the area,\u201d the Mexican National Guard wrote.\nThe photos show an enterprising group of scrap metal and glass for use as a bulletproof vehicle, allegedly owned by the Los Viagras cartel, which is currently engaged in a territorial conflict with other regional players.\nHomemade armored vehicles are colloquially referred to as \u201cRhino\u201d, \u201cBatmobile\u201d, \u201cMonster\u201d, or even e \u201cPapemobil\u201d, according to Mexico Daily News. Some of them are additionally equipped with inch-thick steel panels and retain the ability to travel at about 70 miles per hour, hammering nails and oil stains to repel their pursuers from behind.\nHoughton stressed that the armored vans used primarily by the CJNG include everything from Ford F150 and 250 to Dodge Ram 1500 to Jeep Wranglers, Hummers and Chevrolet Colorados. He also stressed that, based on extensive intelligence collection, the main cartels own several fragmentation grenades and Molotov pumps.\nThere are also Russian-made RPG-7 rocket launchers, M2.50 caliber machine guns, M19.30 caliber machine guns, M60 machine guns, RPD light machine guns and M-249 machine guns.\n\u201cThe most common way to bring weapons into the country is to trade ants, where hundreds of people individually purchase one or more weapons that they deliver to the groups responsible for shipping them to Mexico,\u201d he continued, adding that the infamous Drug Tunnels as a means of drug trafficking north also \u201chave increased over time with lights, ventilation systems and electric train systems.\u201d\nAt least half of the firearms obtained by the cartels, experts say, are exported from the United States. A 2020 report published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) shows that weapons are smuggled in small quantities, with cartels providing arms through \u201cstraw purchases\u201d that involve recruiting people with \u201cclean\u201d records to buy weapons and then illegally transferring them.\nGrillo noted that much of the cartels' skills have recently fallen from their ability to customize and upgrade everything from drones to vehicles to imported weapons\u2014like taking a conventional semi-automatic rifle and turning it into a machine gun or augmenting a simple drone with explosives.\nTo keep up with air and land, maritime space is also a fast-growing arena for cartels.\nLate last year, the world's first drug submarine used for smuggling was seized off the European coast by Spanish authorities, raising questions about how ships risked going thousands of miles undetected. While this particular vessel, not yet fully underwater, has been linked to cartels in Colombia, intelligence reports show that Mexican units have similar capabilities when it comes to self-propelled semi-submersible vehicles (SPSS) or low-profile vessels (LPV).\n\u201cThis drug trafficking model has been in use since 1993, and cartels have started using it on semi-submersible submarines so that most of the cabin and exhaust pipes are visible above the water,\u201d Houghton explained. \u201cHowever, there are already new fully submersible models that cannot be detected by infrared systems, radars or sonars, and even when they are capable of transporting large quantities of drugs, their design becomes more complex and, if they are detected, the losses are significant.\nMoreover, Johan Obdola, President of Canada's Global Intelligence Organization (IOSI) and former head of the drug enforcement department in Venezuela, said it was difficult to establish the number of drug dealers used for drug trafficking in Mexico.\n\u201cWe now know that the use of drug submarines and drug traffickers as tactical weapons is being tested in Mexico's Sinaloa and the Jalisco Nueva Generacion Cartel,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd mostly Cartel del Golf, with support from Colombia, cartels and terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, as well as Al Qaeda and Islamic State militants.\u201d\nAnd while Mexico has dozens of cartels with various gun stores, analysts are increasingly pointing to CJNG as the organization responsible not only for moving about one-third of all drugs from Mexico to the United States \u2014 according to official US government figures \u2014 but also as using these proceeds to develop a cache of weapons, equipment, and vehicles that pose the biggest threat to Mexico's armed forces.\n\u201cJalisco Nueva Generacion CJNG is becoming the most powerful drug cartel in Mexico,\u201d Obdola warned.\nAnd the cartel itself, of course, does not hide its skills. Over the summer, CJNG released a video of one of its convoys dressed in camouflage trucks, pickups, and SUVs full of installed weapons and armor, as well as heavily armed personnel dressed in tactical gear.\n\u201cThe Jalisco Nueva Generacion Cartel, or CJNG, is just one example of a cartel that has reorganized its fighters into fully equipped paramilitary units with their own armored vehicles, commercial pickups covered with steel armor plates,\u201d said Miguel Miranda, a global expert analyst in howling new equipment. \u201cThe biggest cartels have always held significant stocks of small arms for their fighters. But three different weapons have made the cartels better armed than any local police force they might encounter. We are talking about the RPG-7, an ubiquitous missile launcher that originated in the Soviet Union \u2014 a Barrett .50 anti-material rifle manufactured in the United States and a Browning caliber heavy machine gun.",

        "text": "Some hog farms affected by the recent recession could reopen with waste lagoons, though the number may be small.\nBy Gabe Rivin\nIn the North Carolina House and Senate, lawmakers have approved legislation granting a reprieve to inactive hog farms, allowing some older farms to return to operation without meeting newer standards for managing hog waste.\nLawmakers have included the legislative language in two bills: HB 760, the House\u2019s regulatory reform bill, and SB 513, the Senate\u2019s farm bill. Both bills have been approved in their respective chambers.\nThe North Carolina Pork Council, the state\u2019s industry group, has pushed for the legislation, arguing that it protects farmers who have suffered from an unstable demand for pork.\n![A waste lagoon outside of a hog farm. Photo courtesy N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources](https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Hogs_lagoon.jpg?resize=300%2C172&ssl=1)\n\u201cSeveral years ago, around the time that the economy tanked, a couple of pork production companies went bankrupt, and there were a number of farmers that found themselves without a contract with a pork production company,\u201d said Angie Maier, the director of policy development and communications at the Pork Council. \u201c[They were] without pigs, without the ability to make a living.\u201d\nUnder current law, if hog farms have been inactive for four or more years and then return to operation, they must meet the stricter environmental standards placed on new farms.\nThese standards include a ban on the use of anaerobic lagoons, which treat hog waste, and systems that spray the treated waste onto nearby fields.\nBut upgrading to new, more environmentally protective technology can be prohibitively expensive, Maier said.\nThe bills before the General Assembly would rewrite these requirements. Under the Senate\u2019s and House\u2019s bills, hog farmers would be allowed a 10-year window of inactivity. After this period, they would be subject to the environmental standards placed on new farms.\nStatewide research has indicted hog farms for a number of health issues, including increases to nearby residents\u2019 blood pressure and spikes in harmful air pollutants such as hydrogen sulfide. Residents have complained of headaches, diarrhea, drug-resistant bacterial infections and the nuisance of bad odors, an apparent consequence of living near hog farms that use lagoon and sprayfield systems.\nThe issue is most pronounced for residents in North Carolina\u2019s eastern counties, where hog farms are densely clustered. Many residents in these counties are poor and racial minorities, a pattern that environmentalists have cited in a legal complaint to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, claiming that North Carolina\u2019s hog regulations are racially discriminatory. The EPA is currently investigating the claim.\nHowever, the bills before the General Assembly could have a limited impact on health, given the overall size of the industry. The Pork Council estimates that only about 20 farms currently would benefit from the legislative provisions.\nAfter the storms\nNorth Carolina\u2019s current swine regulations date back to the 1990s, when lawmakers and residents witnessed the gruesome combination of eastern hurricanes and industrial animal production.\n![Drowned hogs in the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd. Photo courtesy UNC-Chapel Hill](https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hogs_floyd.jpg?resize=266%2C178&ssl=1)\nIn 1996, Hurricane Fran flooded eastern North Carolina, killing some 16,000 pigs and carrying away the animals\u2019 waste. Three years later, the public saw more images of pink floating bodies, as Hurricane Floyd hurt the state\u2019s pork industry, drowning about 30,000 hogs and once again carrying away their waste.\nThe hurricanes, among other issues, led the General Assembly to set strict limits on the pork industry. Beginning in 1997, hog farmers were prohibited from constructing or expanding farms and waste lagoons.\nIn 2007, the General Assembly passed a law to make the moratorium permanent on lagoons and spray systems. In addition to the moratorium though, the law set additional environmental requirements for new or expanded farms. Under the law, new farms would have to meet environmental performance standards, which called for reduced groundwater contamination and airborne ammonia at farms, among other requirements.\nThe state\u2019s intention was that \u201cthese farms are on the ground, but we think if you\u2019re going to have new farms that you need to meet a higher standard,\u201d said Tom Bean, a consultant with the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cThat\u2019s because lagoon and sprayfield systems were not adequate.\u201d\nBut the 2007 law left an exception. Farms that already had permits were exempt from these standards.\nNumerous farms, then, could still use open-air lagoons and spray systems to manage hog feces, so long as they already had a permit. Yet if a farm sat empty for four or more years, it would lose that  exemption \u2013 a potentially costly problem for farmers, and the reason for this year\u2019s bills.\nTwo sides work together\nEnvironmentalists, including the Environmental Defense Fund, collaborated with the pork industry to shape the legislation, a joint effort that Bean said he appreciated, given the industry\u2019s influence in the General Assembly.\nEnvironmentalists were concerned after House lawmakers approved a version of the legislation with potentially large loopholes. In its original form, the legislation would have allowed an idled farm to reopen without meeting the 2007 standards, so long as it had been idle for five or more years.\n![Hogs_map](https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Hogs_map.jpg?resize=450%2C251&ssl=1)\n\u201cIt seemed ludicrous to imagine that in a hundred years it would still be possible to repopulate a farm no matter how long it had been out of operation, using technology that was current at the end of the 20th century,\u201d Bean said.\nThe provision also could have allowed the reopening of farms that throughout the early 2000s received public funds to close, according to Michelle Nowlin, a lecturer at Duke University\u2019s law school. These were farms that had a higher risk of flooding during large storms and hurricanes.\nThe farms received both state and federal money to close. In addition, some farms received funding through pork giant Smithfield as part of a legal agreement between the company and North Carolina\u2019s state government, seeking a phasing out of open-air lagoons in the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd.\nRecognizing these issues, environmentalists and the pork industry struck a deal on the 10-year window. Additionally, under the bills farms could not reopen with lagoons if they had received public funds or settlement funds to close or if they lay within the areas that historically have flooded.\n\u201cIt is my understanding that all groups are comfortable with the clarifications made forth in this amendment,\u201d said Rep. John Bell (R-Goldsboro), a primary sponsor of HB 760 and the House majority whip, while speaking to the full House.\nBean, of the Environmental Defense Fund, said that he still opposes the new legislation. He also said that the legislation could upset some residents near idled farms.\nBut the Pork Council sees this year\u2019s legislation as bringing parity to the law.\n\u201cIf you have two farms that were built in the same year, that are the same size, and everything about them is the same except one has continued to operate and the other one didn\u2019t have animals for more than four years, there\u2019s nothing different about those two facilities,\u201d Maier said. \u201cThe law was treating them differently, and for an arbitrary reason.\u201d",

        "text": "Photographs showing a large number of pigs on a flooded farm were circulated in the wake of Hurricane Florence in September 2018, along with a caption asserting that the pictures showed \"The victims nobody talks about\":\nThese images are real, but they do not depict the aftermath of that September 2018 storm. The two aerial photographs were actually taken in September 1999 near a farm in North Carolina after Hurricane Floyd, with the largest image in this collage captured by Rick Dove of the Waterkeepers Alliance:\nIn September 1999, almost immediately after receiving two strikes from Hurricane Dennis, Hurricane Floyd came roaring through Eastern North Carolina. In his path lay nearly 2,000 factory farm cesspools loaded with hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic fecal waste, wastewater treatment plants, factories and communities, many of which were in the flood plain.\nHurricane Floyd produced some heavy rains. Unsustainable development greatly aggravated the storm's impacts. Most areas received around 10 inches of rain. A few received 20 inches.\nThe other aerial photograph showing a group of pigs on the roof of a farm structure was taken by photographer Mel Nathason. In addition to creating an \"agricultural nightmare\" that left millions of animals (including an estimated 30,000 hogs) dead, Hurricane Floyd also flooded \"manure lagoons\" causing fecal contamination of North Carolina's drinking water:\nWhat happens when storm floods meet vast confined hog-rearing facilities and their lagoons? The Waterkeeper Alliance\u2019s Rick Dove has been taking extraordinary aerial photos like the one above. Typical hog confinements, like the white buildings on the right in that photo, hold about 2,000 hogs each. According to the Environmental Working Group, there are 586,092 hogs in Wayne County and 229 manure lagoons.\nWaterkeeper Alliance\u2019s Dove told me that in his recent airplane forays over eastern North Carolina, \u201cSome of those lagoons were so submerged that we didn\u2019t even know they were there when we photographed them.\u201d\n[Robert B. Jackson, an environmental scientist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina] pointed to a 1999 hurricane that flooded hog farms in North Carolina. \"Hurricane Floyd came through and flushed the contents of the hog waste lagoons out into the streams and rivers,\" he said. The result was widespread fecal contamination of drinking water. More than decade after Floyd, North Carolina still has more than 4,000 hog waste lagoons.\nWe have not been able to pinpoint the exact origins of the two close-up photographs showing a hog in flooded waters but these images were both likely taken in 2008 during a flood in Iowa. Both images are included on the web site of the Kinship Circle, an Animal Advocacy, Education and Disaster Rescue organization that saved hundreds of hogs after a massive flood left some parts of Iowa under 12 feet of water.\nAlthough these pictures didn't originate with Hurricane Florence, North Carolina may be facing similar problems to encountered after Hurricane Floyd. The state has changed some of their farming policies since 1999 to prevent similar agriculture disasters, but manure pits at some hog farms have reportedly failed in the wake of Hurricane Florence:\nFlooded rivers from Florence\u2019s drenching rains have swamped coal ash dumps and low-lying hog farms, raising pollution concerns as the swollen waterways approach their crests.\nNorth Carolina environmental regulators say several open-air manure pits at hog farms have failed, spilling pollution. State officials also were monitoring the ongoing threat from the breach of a Duke Energy coal ash landfill near Wilmington.\nA similar photograph of drowned pigs was circulated in conjunction with Florence, but this one stemmed from a flood in Vietnam the previous year and had nothing to do with the September 2018 hurricane:",

        "text": "Meat Production Methods\nWe have seen that in order to remain economically viable and feed large numbers of people, modern agriculture in the United States has had to become larger and more mechanized. As agriculture developed to supply meat and poultry to large numbers of people at a low cost, the primary objective became implementing methods that promoted the faster growth of animals. Methods of meat production include concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), also called feedlots, and free-range grazing. Meat production is less efficient than agriculture; it takes approximately 20 times more land to produce the same amount of calories from meat as plants.\nIn 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), roughly 150 million animals were slaughtered for beef, pork and lamb, along with billions of chickens, turkeys and ducks. Many of these animals were raised in CAFOs. Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are used as a way to quickly get livestock ready for slaughter. They are large indoor or outdoor structures designed for maximum output. They tend to be crowded, and animals are fed grains or feed that are not as suitable as grass. This type of high-density animal farming is used for beef cattle, dairy cows, hogs and poultry, all of which are confined or allowed very little movement during all or part of their life cycle. A CAFO may contain as many as 2,500 hogs or 50,000 turkeys in a single building. By keeping animals confined, farmers minimize land costs, improve feeding efficiency, and increase the fraction of food energy that goes into the production of animal body mass. Keeping animals confined to a small space, which is criticized by some on ethical grounds, ensures that less energy is expended by the animal in activities such as moving around and the increased respiration that will result. The animals are given antibiotics and nutrient supplements to reduce the adverse health effects and diseases, which would normally be high in such highly concentrated animal populations.\nIn 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), roughly 150 million animals were slaughtered for beef, pork and lamb, along with billions of chickens, turkeys and ducks.

The animals are given antibiotics and nutrient supplements to reduce the adverse health effects and diseases, which would normally be high in such highly concentrated animal populations.\nHigh-density animal farming has many environmental and health consequences. There is evidence that antibiotics given to confined animals are contributing to an increase in antibiotic-resistant strains of microorganisms that affect humans. Additionally, feedlots generate a large amount of organic waste, which can contaminate ground and surface water. Waste-disposal is a serious problem. An average CAFO produces over 2,000 tons of manure annually, or about as much as a town of 5,000 people would produce. The waste is used to fertilize nearby agriculture fields, but if over-applied, as is usually the case, it can cause the same nutrient runoff problems as synthetic fertilizer. Sometimes animal wastes are stored in lagoons adjacent to feedlots, but during heavy rainstorms (or hurricanes in eastern NC), runoff from these lagoons can contaminate nearby waterways. Animal wastes have also been dumped, either inadvertently or intentionally, into natural waters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded that chicken, hog and cattle waste has caused pollution along 56,000 km (35,000 miles) of rivers in 22 states and has caused some degree of groundwater contamination in 17 states.\nThe use of feedlots are less expensive than other methods, which can keep costs to consumers down, but there are methods for animal production that have a lower environmental impact. Not all meat comes from CAFOs. Free-range chicken and beef are becoming increasingly popular in the United States. Some people find it more ethically acceptable to eat a chicken or cow  that has wandered free than one that has spent its entire life confined in a small space. Free-range meat, if properly produced, is more likely to be sustainable than meat produced in CAFOs. Because these free-range animals are not as likely to spread disease as those kept in close quarters, the use of antibiotics and other medications can be reduced or eliminated. The animals graze or feed on the NPP of the land, eating grass during their entire lifecycle with little or no supplemental feeding, so less fossil fuel goes into the raising of free-range meat. Finally, manure and urine are dispersed over the range area and are naturally processed by detritivores and decomposers in the soil. As a result, there is no need to treat and dispose of massive quantities of manure. Organic waste from these animals act as fertilizer. On the negative side, free-range operations use more land than CAFOs do, and the cost of meat produced using this technique is usually significantly higher.\nOvergrazing occurs when too many animals feed on a particular area of land. Overgrazing causes loss of vegetation, which leads to soil erosion. This usually occurs in grasslands where overgrazing leaves bare patches where roots no longer hold the soil together. When this is combined with the action of rain and wind, the bare patches become bigger and soil is removed from the area. As soil formation is a slow process, it will take many years for a region to recover. Overgrazing can also cause desertification. Desertification is the degradation of low precipitation regions toward being increasingly arid until they become deserts.\nLess consumption of meat could reduce CO2, methane and N2O emissions, conserve water, reduce the use of antibiotics and growth hormones, and improve topsoil. The activities associated with growing, harvesting, processing and preparing food require a great deal of energy. When we consume meat, we also have to keep in mind the amount of energy that went into producing the food for the livestock.\nRaising beef requires more resources than growing corn. Let's look at some of the actual numbers.\nOn farms in the midwestern U.S., a hectare of land yields roughly 370 bushels of corn (150 bushels per acre). A bushel consists of 1,250 ears of corn, and each ear typically contains 80 kilocalories. Assume that a person eats only corn and requires 2,000 kilocalories per day. Although this assumption is not very realistic, it allows an approximation of how much land it would take to feed that person.\nThe person's food requirement is\n2,000 kilocalories/day x 365 days/year = 730,000 kilocalories/year\nA hectare of corn produces\n370 bushels/hectare x 1,250 ears/bushel x 80 kilocalories/ear = 37,000,000 kilocalories/hectare\n730,000,000/year divided by 37,000,000 kilocalories/hectare = 0.02 ha (0.05 acres) of land to feed one person per year\nThus, one person eating only corn can obtain sufficient calories in a year from 0/02 ha (0.05 acres) of land. What if that person ate only beef? It takes about 20 kg of grain to produce 1 kg of beef. So it would take 20 times as much land, or 0.4 ha (1 acre) to feed a person who ate only beef.\nWhat happens if we extend this analysis to a global scale? If Earth has about 1.5 billion ha (3.7 billion acres) of land suitable for growing food, is there sufficient land to feed all 7.7 billion inhabitants of the planet of they all eat a diet of only beef?\n7.7 billion people x 0.4 ha/person = 3, 080,000,000 ha\nSo 3.08 billion ha (7.61 billion acres) would be needed and the answer is no.\nRaising beef requires more resources than growing corn.

If Earth has about 1.5 billion ha (3.7 billion acres) of land suitable for growing food, is there sufficient land to feed all 7.7 billion inhabitants of the planet of they all eat a diet of only beef?\n7.7 billion people x 0.4 ha/person = 3, 080,000 ,000 ha\nSo 3.08 billion ha (7.61 billion acres) would be needed and the answer is no.",

        "text": "According to Mercy for Animals, over 3.4 million chickens and over 5,000 pigs have died as a result of Hurricane Florence and its associated flooding. This was an event that had several days of warning, whole communities were evacuated.\nAnimal Evac New Zealand does not have a position on whether factory farms are right or wrong, as our constitutional rules prevent us to advocate on animal welfare issues that do not pertain to disaster management. That is so we can work with farmers, let it be traditional livestock or intensive farming operators; and respond to help without judgement should the need arise.\nWe do however, want to mitigate any animal suffering during disasters and given the majority of civil defence emergencies in New Zealand are flood or storm related, we know that there is much we can do to prevent these vulnerable animals from drowning, a sufferable death.\nFirstly, we advocate that in particular, intensive farming facilities are not built in disaster prone areas such as flood plains, near fault lines or exposed to tsunami or storm surge. Many however have been built in hazardous areas and so increasing their resilience is critical to animal welfare.\nSuch resilience enhancements may include seismic bracing for cage systems, robust redundant utilities (power, water, heating and waste systems), suitable fire detection and suppression systems, creation of ponds for firefighting water supply, building \u201clilly pads\u201d or raised earth where animals can naturally seek refuge above flood water, and flood barrier systems that can protect facilities and animals from water. Such mitigation systems also can prevent major environmental damage from effluent storage ponds and masses of dead animals. It makes economic and reputational sense, as there is less business interruption and prevents the negative press coverage as seen by overseas events.\nBut there is also a legal obligation too. The defence provisions within the Animal Welfare Act 1999 that apply during times or stress or emergency, only apply if the situation was necessary for the preservation of human life. With hours to days of warning for floods, and the foresight that being in a flood zone will inevitably lead to the facility being affected by floods, means such a defence is unlikely to be acceptable and the obligations to protect animals from floods remain.\nAnimal Evac NZ is seeking further information from the Ministry for Primary Industries to see what progress is being made around animal emergency management within the poultry and pork industries. We expect government to ensure such farm operators are provided sufficient advice and support to mitigate the disaster risks to such vulnerable animals. Farmers wanting advice or support can also contact us.",

Mike Pence, who debated vice presidential rival Tim Kaine Tuesday night in Virginia. \"That was my first hire, as we would say in Las Vegas. And I\u2019ll tell you: he\u2019s a good one.\u201d\nThe Republican nominee called Pence's performance \u201cincredible\u201d and assessed Pence as \u201cphenomenal,\" \"cool,\u201d and \u201csmart.\u201d He also saw it as an opportunity for Americans to \u201clook first hand at my judgement\u201d in people.\nThe praise of Pence\u2019s success comes as CNBC\u2019s John Harwood reported some in Trump\u2019s orbit anticipated an unhappy Trump after being upstaged by his Number 2. \"Pence won overall, but lost with Trump,\u201d CNBC reported, quoting a senior Trump advisor late Tuesday night.\nBut Pence advisor Nick Ayers told NBC News after the debate Trump was \u201cthrilled with Mike\u2019s debate performance tonight.\u201d According to Ayers, the debate performance from the Indiana Governor \u201cwill only further energize\u201d Trump and the campaign.\nBefore Trump\u2019s rally, the GOP nominee spoke at a Las Vegas private school about what he framed as Pence\u2019s style and substance victory. \u201cI mean he won, but he won on the issues, he won on, somebody said he won on style, the style doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 the issues, the policy matters. And he\u2019s getting tremendous reviews from me and everybody.\u201d\nOne notable moment of departure between the men at the top of the GOP ticket was further exacerbated here on Wednesday. While Pence\u2019s rhetoric was harsh on Russia and President Putin, calling him a \u201csmall and bullying leader,\u201d Trump has been receptive to, and largely uncritical of, the Russian leader.\nPushing back on attacks that \u201cTrump loves Putin,\u201d Trump told the Henderson crowd gathered in an open-air amphitheater just off the Vegas strip it\u2019s not love \u2013 but it\u2019s not hate either. \u201cI don\u2019t love, I don\u2019t hate, we\u2019ll see how it works,\u201d Trump mused. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have a good relationship, maybe we\u2019ll have a horrible relationship, maybe we\u2019ll have a relationship right in the middle.\u201d Whatever the outcome, Trump still saw upside in the US joining forces with Russia to knock out ISIS.\nIn the past, Trump has praised Putin as a stronger leader than President Obama -- a statement that Gov.

        "text": "Trump said it (full transcript below).\nHowever, he did not make the remarks during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 but years earlier during a campaign event in November 2016.\nIn April 2020, as the death toll in the United States from the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic approached 18,000, a video supposedly showing U.S. President Donald Trump encouraging people to vote even if they were gravely ill started to circulate on social media:\nThis is a genuine video of Trump saying \"I don't care if you're sick. [...] Get out and vote.\" However, Trump made these remarks in November 2016, not during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe video was filmed during a campaign rally in Nevada on Nov. 6, 2016. It shows then-candidate Trump urging supporters to vote even if they just been given the \"worst possible prognosis.\"\nTrump said:\nYou got to get out there November 8th. I say kiddingly but I mean it: I don't care how sick you are. I don't care if you just came back from the doctor, and he gave you the worst possible prognosis, meaning it's over. You won't be around in two weeks. Doesn't matter. Hang out 'til November 8. Get out and vote. And then all we're going to say is, 'We love you and we will remember you always.'\nWe reported on this video when it first went viral in November 2016. And while the video is genuine, Trump was speaking to his supporters just days before the 2016 presidential election, not -- despite captions that suggest otherwise -- during the 2020 election.",

(As if anyone could really tell among the masked and costumed beings posing for photos and cavorting in the desert.)\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t,\u201d said Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn owner-turned-\"Alienstock\" festival host Connie West, proprietor of the 10-room motel and cafe that became the center of the extraterrestrial-seeking universe.\n\u201cBut we found peace.

Preparations had been made for up to 5,000.\nAuthorities said more than 1,000 people visited Area 51 gates near Rachel on Thursday and Friday. Officials didn\u2019t report the number on Saturday. Holt said Lincoln County sheriff\u2019s deputies on the public side of the gates were sent home early Sunday.\nIn the end, no one actually \u201cstormed\u201d Area 51, although deputies in rural Nye County resorted to \u201cheated warnings\u201d to disperse as many as 200 people who gathered before dawn Friday near a conspicuously green \u201cArea 51 Alien Center\u201d in Amargosa Valley, Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said. No one was arrested.\nA permit for a festival at that site, which is about a 90-minute drive west of Las Vegas, was denied by county officials.\nRELATED\n![](https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/v2/ZNOPSBYHYZFLTNH2XYI7GZJQ4M.jpg?auth=583cd8d7fbf8f16f623c5830193944c49a0594b5d0afe3ac5ed9b962f2ccf131&width=1199&height=629)\nIn Lincoln County, six people were arrested during the weekend for misdemeanors, mostly trespassing beneath the floodlights and cameras of two military base gates and the watchful eyes of sheriff\u2019s deputies from far-flung corners of Nevada.\nSheriff Kerry Lee said he watched about 20 people feign a rush before dawn Saturday toward a base gate outside Rachel, before stopping short.\nTwo men were detained by military security officers inside the perimeter of the vast Nevada Test and Training Range, an area almost twice the size of Delaware where the U.S. Air Force conducts aerial combat and bomb training, and tests stealth aircraft. The men were turned over to sheriff\u2019s deputies and charged with trespassing, Lee said, and their vehicle was impounded.\nHolt said three people critically hurt in rollover crashes during the weekend were sent to hospitals in Las Vegas and St. George, Utah. Motorists involved in crashes that killed two cows on the open range escaped serious injury.\nAt a festival clinic in Rachel, one man was treated Friday for dehydration, and one woman was treated early Sunday for drug-related issue.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call it a success from our end. It\u2019s because we got out in front of it,\u201d said Varlin Higbee, a rancher and Lincoln County commissioner who signed an emergency declaration earlier this month.\nOfficials had feared unruly crowds would overwhelm water, electricity, food, fuel, internet and telephone service in a county with just 5,200 people covering an area the size of Massachusetts.\nHigbee said commissioners who allocated $250,000 in emergency fu nds to brace for trouble might sue to recoup costs.\n\u201cThink about it,\u201d Higbee said. \u201cHere\u2019s an illegal event, supporting an illegal activity \u2014 storming the gate. We\u2019re not sure what we\u2019re going to do at this point.\u201d\nHe compared the initial internet post to an incitement to violence.\nRELATED\n![](https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/v2/VFKK6ATUP5BTHJXC26MQEQJYPQ.jpg?auth=2261d84ec6440f116ad73a4ac64223df182545a48d0668c5bd1ff0882c041f8c&width=1199&height=629)\nMatty Roberts, the 20-year-old from Bakersfield, California, has acknowledged his \u201cstorm Area 51\u201d Facebook post in June was a hoax.\nBut he promoted events in Rachel before breaking earlier this month with West.\nHe said Sunday that Lincoln County officials didn\u2019t have to spend money and could have simply prevented events in Rachel and Hiko by denying permits, like Nye County did in Amargosa Valley.\nRoberts hosted a Thursday evening event at an outdoor venue in downtown Las Vegas, also using the \u201cAlienstock\u201d name. He said he wants to trademark the name and take it on tour to reach people who couldn\u2019t travel to Nevada.\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the plan for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a ton of fun.\u201d\nWest, in Rachel, said she\u2019s open to holding her festival again next year.\n\u201cAs well as it turned out?

        "text": "HIKO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 Thousands of curious Earthlings from around the globe traveled to festivals, and several hundred made forays toward the secret Area 51 military base in the Nevada desert on Friday, drawn by an internet buzz and a social media craze sparked by a summertime Facebook post inviting people to \"Storm Area 51.\"\n\"They can't stop all of us,\" the post joked. \"Lets see them aliens.\"\nIn the end \u2014 at the appointed hour of 3 a.m. Sept. 20 \u2014 about 75 to 100 people braved chilly darkness and a bumpy, dusty 8-mile (13-kilometer) drive to the Rachel gate of the legendary former top-secret U.S. Air Force base. Another 40 traveled about 20 miles (32 kilometers) a more rugged washboard-dirt road to a different gate.\nThe sheriff in neighboring Nye County reported that about 40 people gathered overnight at a conspicuously green \"Area 51 Alien Center\" in Amargosa Valley about 3 a.m. and approached a base gate before leaving after \"heated warnings\" from officers.\nNo one found UFOs or space aliens, Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said.\nThey did find they weren't alone, amid bright floodlights, watchful cameras and who-knows-what in a squat tan bunker building with blackout windows \u2014 all surrounded by razor wire.\nPolite and patient local sheriff's deputies ushered one woman away when she stepped too far forward. They arrested a man from Canada who urinated near the gate and cited him for indecent exposure, Lee said. The woman was released with a warning.\n\"We intend to keep those officers there throughout the event,\" Lee told reporters Friday. \"You know: Come. Look. See what you can see. But just don't cross.\"\nAs he spoke, a trickle of vehicles grew to a stream on a two-lane state road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway toward Rachel, a town of 50 residents now hosting more than 2,000 \"Alienstock\" campers and alien-seekers.\nAnother event started in Hiko, a crossroads town a 45-minute drive closer to Las Vegas.\nMeanwhile, Matty Roberts, a 20-year-old from Bakersfield, California, who sparked the Area 51 phenomenon with a late-night Facebook post and then broke with Little A'Le'Inn owner Connie West over production of the Rachel event, hosted a Thursday evening event at an outdoor venue in downtown Las Vegas also using the \"Alienstock\" name.\n\"It started as a joke and now people are getting to know each other,\" said Tracy Ferguson, 23, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, who said the internet gave him the idea to drive to Nevada with his girlfriend, Jade Gore, 19, of Worthington, Minnesota.\nGore quit her job at a Dairy Queen and dyed her hair and eyebrows green. They drove through Wyoming, Utah and into Nevada with \"Area 51 bound\" and \"Comin 4 Dem Alien Cheeks\" in green paint on their car windows.\n\"People were taking pictures and laughing the whole way,\" Gore said.\nBy noon they'd visited the Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel, the Alien Research Center in Hiko and the Rachel gate to Area 51. By Saturday, they'll be in Las Vegas, a more than two-hour drive away.\n\"Area 51 Basecamp\" in Hiko was set to feature music, speakers and movies \u2014 headlined by an electronic dance music DJ who tours the world and attracts packed clubs on the Las Vegas Strip.\nAlien Research Center owner George Harris said he expected a crowd of 5,000.\nMichael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the festivities a blend of interest in aliens, the supernatural, government conspiracies and the desire to know what is unknown.\nA sheriff's deputy at the Rachel gate ticked off the countries he said visitors came from: Russia, Germany, Peru, Sweden.\nCyril Soudant, 25, of Lille, France, said he was disappointed not to see more people at the events.\nSoudant took video for his YouTube channel and said he would wait until Friday night to make a final assessment on the experience.\n\"We all know we can't cross the gate,\" Soudant said. \"But if tonight we get together, have some music, have some beers, that would be a success.\"\nVincent Dahl of Stockton, California, awoke at the \"Alienstock\" campground in remote Nevada looking to hitch a ride to the nearest gate. John Derryberry and Sarah Shore, a couple from Nashville, Tennessee, happily obliged.\nBy the time they made the dusty 8-mile (13-kilometer) drive, the trio in their mid-20s were practically old friends.\n\"We're the power of the collective. It's the Woodstock for this generation,\" said Dahl, wearing a tinfoil hat \"to prevent the government from reading my mind.\" He referred to the August 1969 music and counterculture festival that attracted an estimated 1 million people and overwhelmed to the small town of Bethel, New York.\nAlong with Derryberry, wearing a Buzz Lightyear costume, and Shore dancing in a glittery cape, the three posed for photos amid dozens of other gawkers at the gate.\n\"There's a great sense of community among everyone here,\" Derryberry said.",

This is their event as much as it is mine.\"\nLincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee called activities \"pretty calm\" early Saturday in Rachel and Hiko.\nEmergency services chief Eric Holt said the number of law enforcement officers and medics were being scaled back, but that officials weren't becoming complacent.\nHe said resources mustered from around the state to handle up to 30,000 people probably won't be needed for the estimated 3,000 campers and festival-goers at \"Alienstock\" in Rachel.\n\"The best-case scenario is pretty much what happened,\" Holt said.\nIn Nye County, Sheriff Sharon Wehrly reported no one showed up early Saturday at a main entrance and an auxiliary gate at the once-secret Area 51 U.S. Air Force facility.\nWehrly revised to 100 each the number of people who appeared at each of those gates early Friday near Amargosa Valley, a 90-minute drive west of Las Vegas.\nLee and Holt, about a two-hour drive north of Las Vegas, said revelers gathered until about 4 a.m. at two gates between Hiko and Rachel.\nThe sheriff said about 20 people broke from among revelers and \"acted like they were going to storm but stopped short.\"\nLee reported one arrest, for disorderly conduct, at the end of the \"Area 51 Basecamp\" concert in Hiko. That brought the number of arrests since Thursday to seven - all misdemeanors and most for trespassing.\nHolt said one man was treated for dehydration by festival medics in Rachel, and a man reported missing Friday morning after heading Thursday from a festival campground in Hiko toward an Area 51 gate was found safe Friday evening. He said he didn't have any other details.\nTwo crashes were reported involving vehicles hitting cows, Holt said. Motorists weren't injured. Officials noted the highway between Hiko and Rachel is open range for cattle grazing.\nThe vibe among the assembled humans, which Lee estimated totaled in the low thousands, remained mostly harmless.\nWhile costumed space aliens were a common and sometimes hilarious sight in events that began Thursday, no one has reported seeing actual extraterrestrials or UFOs.",

        "text": "Revelers reach gates of Area 51 then peacefully rejoin party\nHundreds of curious Earthlings from around the world traveled to the secret Area 51 military base in the Nevada desert after seeing an internet hoax dubbed 'Storm Area 51.'\nHIKO, Nev. - Hundreds of curious Earthlings from around the world traveled to the secret Area 51 military base in the Nevada desert after seeing an internet hoax dubbed \"Storm Area 51.\"\nAbout 100 made it all the way to the gates of the remote site that has long been the focus of UFO conspiracy theories.\nA Canadian was cited for indecent exposure, but nobody broke down the gates in search of three-eyed aliens and no UFOs appeared in the sky.\nIt wasn't long before the revelers peacefully rejoined 2,000 other people at alien-themed festivals in the tiny towns of Rachel and Hiko.\nAs he walked away from one of the gates, 25-year-old Cyril Soudant of Lille, France, said he was disappointed at how few people were at the event.\nHe took video for his YouTube channel and said he would wait until Friday night to make his final assessment on the experience.\n\"If we get together, have some music, have some beers, that would be a success,\" Soudant said.\nAmong the revelers was Jade Gore, who quit her job at a Dairy Queen in Worthington, Minnesota, and drove to Nevada with Tracy Ferguson. They wrote \"Area 51 bound\" and \"Comin 4 Dem Alien Cheeks\" in green paint on the windows of their car.\n\"People were taking pictures and laughing the whole way,\" said Gore, 19, who sported dyed green hair and eyebrows.\nFerguson, a truck driver, said they decided to make the trip after seeing the social media post in June calling for people to converge on the remote U.S. Air Force test site.\n\"It started as a joke and now people are getting to know each other,\" said Ferguson, 23, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\nAuthorities expected more people to arrive throughout the day for the festivals offering music and other alien-related activities.\nThey were sternly discouraged by the military and other law enforcement from acting on the internet hoax that joking said, \"They can't stop all of us. Let's see them aliens.\"\nA music group called Wily Savage erected a stage Thursday near the Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel and began playing after dark for several hundred campers who braved temperatures that dropped to about 45 degrees (7 Celsius).\n\"It started as a joke, but it's not a joke for us,\" Wily Savage guitarist Alon Burton said. \"We know people will come out. We just don't know how many.\"\nDaniel Martinez, 31, a dealer of Pokemon collectible cards from Pomona, California, was among the first to whirl and dance at the dusty makeshift festival grounds. He stayed warm beneath a wolf \"spirit hood\" and faux fur jacket.\n\"Here's a big open space for people to be,\" he said. \"One person starts something and it infects everybody with positivity. Anything can happen if you give people a place to be.\"\nAnother gathering was planned Friday and Saturday at the Alien Research Center souvenir store in Hiko. Owner George Harris said his \"Alien Basecamp\" would focus on music, movies and talks about extraterrestrial lore.\nHiko and Rachel are a 45-minute drive apart on a state road dubbed Extraterrestrial Highway, and a two-hour drive from Las Vegas.\nMichael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the festivities a blend of interest in aliens, the supernatural, government conspiracies and the desire to know what is unknown.\n\"Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can't go. When you tell people they can't do something, they just want to do it more,\" Borer said.",

There was no stopping it.\"\nRachel resident Joerg Arnu, who can see the festival site from his house, said: \"Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time.\"\nBut he added that those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against \"critters, snakes, and scorpions.\"\n\"It will get cold at night.\n\"They're not going to find what they're looking for, and they are going to get angry,\" he said.\nMobile phone signal is already patchy in Rachel, and officials expect what service there is to be overwhelmed by the number of people.\nWe pay for your stories!

(Army News Service, May 26, 2009) -- Neither the heat nor the threat of rain deterred thousands of people who gathered at Arlington National Cemetery's Memorial Amphitheater Monday morning for the 2009 National Memorial Day Observance.\nPresident Barack Obama spoke to the audience, made up of civilians, government officials, veterans, servicemembers and their Families after laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.\nThe president said those buried at Arlington \"waged war so that we may know peace ... They were willing to give up everything for the defense of our freedom [and] were willing to sacrifice all for their country.\"\n\"They are the best of America,\" Obama said.\nObama spoke of the history represented in Arlington National Cemetery, where Confederate and Union Soldiers lie side by side, surrounded by men and women who fell while fighting in the hope their descendants wouldn't have to.\n\"We pay tribute to those who forged our history, but hold closely the memory of those so recently lost,\" the president said. \"And even as we gather here this morning, all across America people are pausing to remember, to mourn and to pray.\"\nHe lauded the members of the military, noting that he himself did not serve. His grandfather served in World War II. He hinted at current events, saying servicemembers --who are all volunteers -- stand above many of their fellow Americans because they \"answered a call\" to serve a purpose greater than themselves.\n\"Why in an age when so many have acted only in pursuit of narrowest self-interest have the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines of this generation volunteered all that they have on behalf of others,\" he said. \"Why have they been willing to bear the heaviest burden'\"\n\"Whatever it is, they felt some tug ... they said 'I'll go.' That is what separates them from those who have not served in uniform, their extraordinary willingness to risk their lives for people they never met,\" Obama said.\nObama said, unlike the servicemembers, veterans and Family members in the audience, he cannot possibly know how it feels to march into battle, or what it's like to lose a child.\n\"I do know this: I am humbled to be the commander-in-chief of the finest fighting force in the history of the world,\" Obama said.\n\"I know that there is nothing I will not do to keep our country safe, even as I face no harder decision than sending our men and women to war, and no moment more difficult than writing a letter to the Families of the fallen,\" he added.\nThe president said he would do everything he could do to keep America's servicemembers out of harm's way. But when fighting is necessary, he said, he would be sure they had whatever tools they need to get the job done.\n(Ian Graham writes for the Pentagram newspaper at Fort Myer, Va.)",

        "text": "Military-backed efforts to find an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress are making sluggish progress. The Pentagon is funding all kinds of ideas -- from yoga to telepsychology. Each has its limitations.\nBut one doctor is convinced he's found a viable way to treat the estimated 20 percent of troops now coming home with PTSD -- if only the Pentagon would give it a shot.\nDr. Eugene Lipov, a Chicago-based anesthesiologist, pioneered the modern-day use of stellate-ganglion block, or SGB, in 2004 to eliminate hot flashes among post-menopausal women. SGB, which has been used to relieve migraines and chronic pain since the 1920s, involves a single injection into the sympathetic nerve tissue on the right side of a cervical vertebra.\nAfter finding a Finnish paper on the use of SGB to treat anxiety, Lipov started trying it out on patients with post-traumatic stress.\n\"My first patient had been robbed at gunpoint,\" Lipov tells Danger Room. \"He walked into my office with extreme anxiety, and walked out changed. That was three years ago, and he's still doing fine.\"\nLipov went on to try SGB in eight civilians and four veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. His first patient, a vet who awoke to find himself strangling his wife, said the procedure's impact was \"immediate.\" The effects took only seven minutes to kick in, but subsided nearly instantly after a fireworks display retriggered the condition. A second shot, in 2008, alleviated the PTSD again. \"Since then, it's so far, so good,\" Lipov says.\nIt sounded promising, except Lipov and other SGB advocates didn't know precisely how the method actually worked -- only that it did. That may have changed last February, when Lipov published a paper in Medical Hypothesis, describing what he thinks is the mechanism by which SGB targets PTSD. The injection appears to turn off nerve growth factor (NGF), which can surge during stressful experiences and promote the sprouting of nerves in the stellate ganglion. That triggers chronic stress, or what's known as the \"fight or flight\" response.\nLipov already has FDA clearance for use of SGB in post-traumatic-stress victims. And doctors at Walter Reed took note of the progress, and tried SGB on two veterans last year. \"Although an admittedly small series of patients, our report points to a potentially effective and readily accessible approach for PTSD treatments,\" the study published in Pain Practice reads.\nSo does that mean Pentagon funding for Lipov's method? Not quite. He's applied twice for federal funds to sponsor further study ($4 million in 2007 and $1 million in 2009) but been denied both times.\nDenied, despite one rather high-profile backer. In 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama wrote a letter to the Army as part of Lipov's funding application. \"There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that PTSD is afflicting a growing number of our heroic service members,\" the letter reads. It \"is important to consider any new approaches that may hold potential for helping our service members get the care they need.\"\nConcerns over risks, especially that the injection can trigger seizures, hit a key artery or puncture the lung, are valid, Lipov admits. Still, they're rare: A 1992 study evaluating 45,000 SGB cases found adverse effects in 20 patients. And Lipov has come up with a distinct method, which he calls the \"Chicago Block,\" that targets the C6 vertebra rather than the traditional C7. Because C6 is farther from important arteries and the lungs, it's less likely to be implicated in problems during an SGB procedure.\n\"Realistically, 1 in 100,000 people might have serious complications,\" he admits. \"Say we treat 300,000 veterans -- that's three people. Compare that to the military's suicide rate.\"\nSo far, the Pentagon isn't listening. Which makes sense: Yes, the military's been open-minded about investigating all kinds of alternative PTSD remedies. But there's a big difference between an hour of downward-facing-dogs and an injected chemical intervention that tries to 180 a patient's fragile hormonal stress responses.\nBut a dearth of Pentagon funds also means that an interesting idea goes under-researched. For now, Lipov is self-funding a limited clinical trial: a single-blind test of SGB injections on war veterans. So far, three patients have received the injection, and Lipov is looking to recruit 19 to 22 more. \"Look, of course everyone would rather wait until 10,000 people have tried it,\" he says. \"I'm trying to get there.\"\nA single procedure costs around $800. Most PTSD patients have shown solid results with only one injection, but Lipov's first patient proved that there's a possibility of relapse. Questions also persist over how long the effects can endure, and what percentage of PTSD sufferers will respond to the method. And, of course, there's the undeniable fact that SGB injections are a Band-Aid treatment, rather than prevention or all-out cure. But according to Lipov, they're the best we can do.\n\"This has been around, it's been d one, it is not going to grow you a new tail,\" he says. \"It's out-of-the-box, I understand that. But, really, with the number of guys we're going to have coming home sick, I'm hard-pressed to see where there's a better option.\"\nPhoto: White House\nIllustration: Eugene Lipov\nSee Also:\n- Pentagon Scientists Inject Necks to 'Cure' PTSD\n- Neuroscientists Say Brain Scans Can Spot PTSD\n- Pentagon Investigates Pill-Popping PTSD Prevention\n- Army's New PTSD Treatments: Yoga, Reiki, 'Bioenergy'\n- Marines Use Brain Scans to Spot PTSD Before the War\n- Ecstasy Pushed as PTSD Treatment\n- Darpa Comes Down to Earth, Plans Online Medicine Portal\n- Military's Mental Health Treatment Leader Steps Down",

        "description": "French electric car boneyard photos circulate the internet. We discussed what really happened and why the story is inaccurate.",
        "text": "2 Electric Car Myths \u2013 The French Electric Car Boneyard\nUsually we write about low carbon transportation. It so happens that here we report on a social media blow up about a mistaken notions about electric cars. What\u2019s the story behind the French electric car boneyard or \u201cgraveyard\u201d as it\u2019s sometimes known?\nIs it really a sign that electric cars are a failure? By now, no one believes electric cars are inferior because the industry is shifting decisively to greater ownership of electric cars. But where did this story come from?\nIn fact, there are now TWO stories about French electric car boneyards. We don\u2019t know why but there\u2019s something about bashing the French and electric cars that seems to catch on every time.\nStory #1: Autolib\u2019 \u2013 The Company Behind The Alleged French Electric Car Boneyard\nThe story starts with Autolib\u2019 (don\u2019t forget the apostrophe) way back in 2011, a car-sharing service that provided electric vehicles in the Paris area. The service was not sustainable as a business and the company filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Multiple news sources debunked the myth that these cars were thrown out because of their uselessness. The upper image was taken of a site in France.\nPart of the problem was that the company didn\u2019t account for the cost of maintaining the cars and for the great mismatch between the number of cars they had and the number of subscribers they enlisted.\nThe result was that subscribers didn\u2019t have enough cars exacerbated by the problem of cars going out of service due to poor maintenance. The cars were sold off and many were left to rot in a lot. According to reports the cars are either in Massy, France or Romorantin-Lanthenay, France.\nStory #2: Microcity \u2013 Car Sharing Service That Failed In Hangzhou\nMultiple sources debunked the second hoax that hundreds of brand new electric cars were abandoned in Paris. In reality, the cars belonged to a bankrupt electric car sharing company and were moved to an empty lot next to the Qiantang River on the outskirts of Hangzhou. The lower image shows the site in China.\nPhotos of the same cars were featured in an article from Shanghai and a news report post on Weibo. The same photos were involved in yet another hoax claiming that Covid19 caused the cars to be abandoned.\nSocial Media Circulates The Photo With An Embelished Story\nLater on, social media users circulated both photographs of the abandoned cars in a boneyard near Paris, France. The captions said the cars had been abandoned and left to decay because their battery storage cells had \u201cgiven out\u201d and were too expensive to replace and hence electric cars were fundamentally faulty.\nThis was implied as a criticism of the technology of the electric vehicles, and thus are unsustainable as a product. The photographs were real, but the accompanying description was misleading in multiple ways. In fact, it was the failure of a business model, not of the technology of the electric cars themselves!\nFact Checkers Debunk Both French Electric Car Boneyard Stories\nBoth Snopes and Politifact investigated the story about the \u201cFrench electric car boneyard\u201d and gave their respective accounts.\nIn the first story when the business failed in 2018, the company sold off most of the cars and had to put the ones in poor condition in a lot. While in the lot, their batteries had been removed anyway and weren\u2019t leaking into the soil as the posters suggested.\nOne of the managers of the lot, Paul Aouizerate was quoted as saying \u201cOur vehicles are properly stored. The firefighters are aware that the construction site is well organized. All batteries have been removed, [and] the connections are isolated\u201d.\nEven Reuters got in on debunking the news story. Reuters also reports that the owners of the company have been selling the cars to another buy so these cars are not simply sitting there as junk.\nIn the second story, internet sleuths pointed out that an article published in Shanghaiist on April 25, 2019 featured a photograph with a skyline matching the same trees, buildings and radio tower as the photograph in the viral posts.\nWhy is it important to debunk the story? Because whenever there\u2019s a policy discussion or decision about increasing use of electric vehicles as a way to combat carbon emissions, critics trot out this ridiculous story to back up their claim that electric vehicle technology is flawed. Again, it was a business case challenge not a technology challenge that this company couldn\u2019t keep it going.\nVelib\u2019 \u2013 The Bike-Share Service That Is A Bright Spot\nRegarding the first story, a related service run by the city, not the parent company of Autolib\u2019, called V\u00e9lib\u2019 M\u00e9tropole remains in service. Bike riders rent bikes that are stored in bike racks.\nState Of The Boneyard In 2022\nFor the first story about Autolib\u2019, in one of the purported locations of Romorantin-Lanthenay, France, there is a large lot of cars that\u2019s been labeled \u201cStockage des Autolib\u201d. This implies that the Autolib cars are being stored. Google maps shows t he cars sitting there. We estimated a little over 1300 cars stored there! An image of the state of the location is shown here.\nSummary TL;DR\nBoth photos are real but the cars were not abandoned because the electric batteries failed. Instead, in both cases, Paris and China, the two different parent company\u2019s business model failed.\nAnne Lauer\nAnnaLauerisawriter,gardener,andhomesteaderlivinginruralWisconsin.ShehaswrittenforMotherEarthNews,Grit,andHobbyFarmsmagazines.Annaiswriting a new bookabout growingyour food for free and an ultimate guide toproducingfood at little to no cost.Whenshe\u2019snotwritingorgardening,Annaenjoysspendingtimewithherhusbandandtwoyoungdaughters.",

        "description": "There's no shortage of misleading online memes about electric vehicles.",
        "text": "On Oct. 12, 2022, an \"alternative-health guru\" named David \"Avocado\" Wolfe tweeted a false meme on the subject of electric vehicles (EVs). The meme claimed to display a photograph that had been taken in France showing hundreds of electric cars that were abandoned due to the high cost of EV battery replacement. However, this caption was very misleading.\nThe meme was engaged with tens of thousands of times.\nThe misleading caption read, \"France: They bought electric cars for civil servants but it was too expensive to replace the batteries. After that, no one else wanted the cars. Now they are here.\"\nThe helpful Twitter account @HoaxEye of hoaxeye.com was quick to debunk the meme. HoaxEye's tweet linked to a comprehensive investigation from The Observers on France24.com.\nThe Observers previously reported that the picture was taken not in France, but rather just outside of Hangzhou, China. They cited several different sources.\nThe photographer who captured the picture was Instagram user @gregabandoned, who explores abandoned places around the world.\nThe cars in the picture belonged to an electric car-sharing company that was named Microcity. Thousands of their Kandi-brand vehicles hit the streets in 2013. However, The Observers reported that there wasn't enough demand for their business. The company went bankrupt in 2019. There's no data to show that EV battery replacement costs had anything to do with the reason the cars were abandoned.\nWe previously reported on other photos that had a similar caption about abandoned electric cars, EV battery replacement costs, and France. In that case, the pictures truly were captured in France. The BlueCar fleet was owned by Autolib, also an electric car-sharing service. However, once again, the electric cars in those pictures were not abandoned because of expensive EV batteries. Instead, a failed business model was to blame, just like with Microcity.",

        "text": "US Election 2016 Results: Five reasons Donald Trump won\n- Published\n![Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump attends a campaign event in Wilmington, Ohio, U.S. November 4, 2016](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/AF36/production/_92345844_trmptop.jpg)\nDonald Trump has defied all expectations from the very start of his presidential campaign more than a year ago.\nVery few people thought he would actually run, then he did. They thought he wouldn't climb in the polls, then he did. They said he wouldn't win any primaries, then he did. They said he wouldn't win the Republican nomination, then he did.\nFinally, they said there was no way he could compete for, let alone win, a general election.\nNow he's President-elect Trump.\nHere are five ways he pulled off what was unexpected by most and incomprehensible to many.\n![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/464/mcs/media/images/75306000/jpg/_75306515_line976.jpg)\nTrump's white wave\n![Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds a campaign rally at the J.S. Dorton Arena November 7, 2016 in Raleigh, North Carolina](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/AAE0/production/_92344734_gettyimages-621651016.jpg)\nToss-ups were tossed aside. One after another, Ohio, Florida and North Carolina went to Mr Trump.\nThat left Mrs Clinton's blue firewall, and the firewall was eventually breached.\nThe Democrat's last stand largely rested on her strength in the Midwest. Those were states that had gone Democrat for decades, based in part on the support of black and working-class white voters.\nThose working-class white people, particularly ones without college education - men and women - deserted the party in droves. Rural voters turned out in high numbers, as the Americans who felt overlooked by the establishment and left behind by the coastal elite made their voices heard.\nWhile places like Virginia and Colorado held fast, Wisconsin fell - and with it Mrs Clinton's presidential hopes.\nWhen all is said and done, Mrs Clinton may end up winning the popular vote on the back of strong support in places like California and New York and closer-than-expected losses in solid-red states like Utah.\nThe Trump wave hit in the places it had to, however. And it hit hard.\n![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/464/mcs/media/images/75306000/jpg/_75306515_line976.jpg)\nTeflon Donald\n![Republican presidential candidates (L-R) Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Donald Trump and Jeb Bush participate in the first prime-time presidential debate hosted by FOX News and Facebook at the Quicken Loans Arena August 6, 2015 in Cleveland, Ohio.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/F900/production/_92344736_gettyimages-483201932.jpg)\nMr Trump insulted decorated war veteran John McCain.\nHe picked a fight with Fox News and its popular presenter, Megyn Kelly.\nHe doubled down when asked how he once mocked the weight of a Hispanic beauty pageant winner.\nHe offered a half-hearted apology when the secret video surfaced of his boasting about making unwanted sexual advances towards women.\nHe gaffed his way through the three presidential debates with clearly lightly practised performances.\nNone of it mattered. While he took dips in the polls following some of the more outrageous incidents, his approval was like a cork - eventually bouncing back to the surface.\nPerhaps the various controversies came so hard and fast that none had time to draw blood. Maybe Mr Trump's personality and appeal was so strong, the scandals just bounced off. Whatever the reason, he was bulletproof.\n![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/464/mcs/media/images/75306000/jpg/_75306515_line976.jpg)\nThe outsider\n![Supporters hold signs and a copy of the Bible during a rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016, in Manchester, N.H.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/8826/production/_92345843_trumpoutside.jpg)\nHe ran against the Democrats. He also ran against the powers within his own party.\nHe beat them all.\nMr Trump built a throne of skulls out of his Republican primary opponents. Some, like Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie and Ben Carson, eventually bent knee. The holdouts, like Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are now on the outside of their party looking in.\nAnd for the rest of the party insiders, from House Speaker Paul Ryan on down? Mr Trump didn't need their help - and, in fact, may have won because he was willing to take a stand against them.\nMr Trump's pox-on-them-all attitude is likely to have proved his independence and outsider status at a time when much of the American public reviled Washington (although not enough to keep them from re-electing most congressional incumbents running for re-election).\nIt was a mood some other national politicians sensed - Democrat Bernie Sanders, for instance, as well as Mr Cruz. No one, however, captured it more than Trump, and it won him the White House.\n![line](https://ichef.bbci.c o.uk/ace/standard/464/mcs/media/images/75306000/jpg/_75306515_line976.jpg)\nThe Comey Factor\n![FBI Director James Comey is sworn in before testifying at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the \"Oversight of the State Department\" in Washington U.S. on July 7, 2016](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/12F6/production/_92345840_comey.jpg)\nThe polls clearly did a woeful job predicting the shape and preferences of the electorate, particularly in Midwestern states. In the final days of the campaign, however, the reality is that the polls were close enough that Mr Trump had a pathway to victory.\nThat pathway didn't look nearly as obvious about two weeks ago, before FBI director James Comey released his letter announcing that they were reopening their investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server.\nTrue, the polls were tightening a bit, but Mr Trump's sharpest rise in the standings came in the weeks between that first letter and Mr Comey's second, in which he said he had put the investigation back on the shelf.\nIt seems likely that during that period, Mr Trump was able to successfully consolidate his base, bringing wayward conservatives back into the fold and shredding Mrs Clinton's hopes of offering a compelling closing message to US voters.\nOf course, Mr Comey's actions never would have been a factor if Mrs Clinton had decided to rely on State Department email servers for her work correspondence. That one is on her shoulders.\n![line](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/464/mcs/media/images/75306000/jpg/_75306515_line976.jpg)\nTrusted his instincts\n![Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump walks onto the stage for a campaign rally, Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016, in Reno, Nev.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/6116/production/_92345842_trumpw5.jpg)\nMr Trump ran the most unconventional of political campaigns, but it turned out he knew better than all the experts.\nHe spent more on hats than on pollsters. He travelled to states like Wisconsin and Michigan that pundits said were out of reach.\nHe held massive rallies instead of focusing on door-knocking and get-out-the-vote operations.\nHe had a disjointed, sometimes chaotic national political convention that was capped by an acceptance speech that was more doom-and-gloom than any in modern US political history.\nHe was vastly outspent by the Clinton campaign, just as he was during the Republican primaries. He turned consensus wisdom about how to win the presidency on its head.\nAll of these decisions - and many more - were roundly ridiculed in \"knowledgeable\" circles.\nIn the end, however, they worked. Mr Trump and his closest confidants - his children and a few chosen advisers - will have the last laugh. And they'll do it from the White House.",

        "text": "![](https://manchesterhistorian.com/wp-content/uploads/a-317x169.png)\nThe United States of America had always been a destination I wanted to travel to from a young age. Perhaps it was the appeal of metropolis-esque cities such as New York or Los Angeles I had seen on TV programmes, the beautiful scenery of national parks across the huge American landscape or possibly the vast history on offer in cities like Washington D.C. This summer however, I got my chance through work at a summer camp in upstate New York.\nOne of the first things to strike me after arriving in the US in June 2016 was the amount of coverage and publicity given to the then-almost Republican candidate in the upcoming Presidential election, Donald Trump. Both his breakthrough to the mainstream of U.S. politics and his eventual election to the White House were revolutionary and proved wrong many people who had laughed off his campaign months before.\nSocial media and news outlets, who gave him endless publicity in the build up to November\u2019s election, pounced upon his seemingly discriminatory attitude to minority populations and often-controversial remarks. Kids at the camp where I was working were keen to bring up the subject of Trump following large exposure to his campaign and staff. Both Americans and Europeans struggled to debate issues other than his nomination, even following the recent British EU referendum results in late June.\nIt was this exposure and hype that proved to be the backbone of Trump\u2019s campaign. Through this he was able to push through his slogans time and time again \u2013 his promises to \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019. In contrast to his opponent, Hilary Clinton with her seemingly less passionate and more policy-focused approach, Trump\u2019s strengths lay in being able to identify and connect with his white male target audience. He made them believe in him and eventually inspired them to go out and vote for him.\nTrump\u2019s campaign from the beginning of the party primaries was, of course, no smooth journey. The New-York businessman began fights with Fox News and their popular journalist Megyn Kelly. He delivered only a half-hearted apology to the surfacing of the horrifically vulgar video clip of his boasting about his sexual advances on women back in 2005. Policies and proposals concerning immigration and the threat of terrorism meant he alienated himself from ethnic and religious groups such as Hispanics, African-Americans and Muslims. His off-the-cuff performances in presidential debates saw him take further hits in the polls.\nHowever, none of this seemed to matter. The Trump train just kept on coming back for more, with Clinton seemingly unable to make a killer blow. While critics often ridiculed his political approach, Trump stuck to his game plan. He focused on states that were seen as out of reach. Swing states including Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania were targeted; all of which he won in the Electoral College, proving crucial in the final election vote.\nEarly 2016 proved successful for the former \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 host. By March, Trump had managed to rise above the trailing pack of Republican nominee hopefuls, including Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. His promise to overthrow the current political establishment led to great eventual success with voters in America\u2019s Midwest. Before the Democratic and Republican conventions, where parties nominate their respective election candidates, the media was already rife with the idea that November would see Trump face off against Clinton, who was facing her own primary battle against Bernie Sanders.\nThis, of course, proved to be the case in the fight for the White House. Four months of extensive campaigning, three presidential debates, and a barrage of insults and accusations from both sides later, Donald Trump\u2019s long-winded campaign looked to be finally failing after one of the most bitter and ugly elections to date.\nPolls suggested a four-point lead for Clinton in the days leading up to the election. However, a promising start in the gradual election results for Clinton turned into a huge problem for the Democratic Party as Trump followed up a decisive victory in key battleground Florida with wins in Ohio and North Carolina. After more critical states fell to Republicans, the result was confirmed in Trump\u2019s favour at around 3:00AM (EST) on Wednesday 9th November, bringing an end to the campaign that had defied all expectations from the very beginning.\nMy time in the U.S., involving two months working at the camp and around four weeks travelling, ended in mid-September. The media attention in the U.S. had unsurprisingly gone hysterical following Clinton\u2019s health concerns at a 9/11 memorial event. Minimal coverage was given to other news stories on networks Fox News and CNN. Despite the slight narrowing of the polls in Trump\u2019s favour, Clinton remained the front-runner, the figure who could finally stop the scandalous Trump. No one envisaged what would happen from then onwards.\nHowever now Americ a faces an unclear future under the guidance of the most controversial President in U.S. political history.",

        "text": "(2)\nBy BlackJack Pershiing\n@pershingsoldier on Twitter and Parler\nDateline 301558 August 2020 Missouri Territory\n\u201c\u2026they are in a terminal panic in Washington. They are frightened. They hear the shouts of the peasants from over the hill. And they\u2019re comin\u2019! They are comin\u2019 with pitchforks after them!\u201d\nPat Buchanan, 1996\nIn the end, Pat didn\u2019t get it done. His insurrection fell flat. Maybe Pat enjoyed being a smart ass more than sealing the deal.\nHowever.\nA billionaire who didn\u2019t need the job secured the presidency with the very peasants Pat spoke of, albeit with a new name \u2013 the deplorables. Four years on, it is happening again with a more diverse and unlikely band of deplorables. In fact you might call in a Grand Coalition.\nUnlike the source of the term, the parliaments of Europe, with multiparty factions that are sometimes sewn together, our Grand Coalition is a coalition of like minded patriots from many divergent groups, parties, races and creeds. A coalition of those willing to save the republic.\nWho makes up the 2020 Grand Coalition for Trump?\nThe Forgotten Men and Women: after being sold out by the Bidens, the Obamas, the Bushes and the Clintons, the forgotten rose up. Many of them with careers cut short as the multinationals they worked for sent their jobs to China and elsewhere. They knew first hand the casual and dismissive way that they were betrayed. \u201cBarack Obama, who was and still is very demonic, made anyone who had turned 50 during his administration feel marginalized and discriminated against.\u201d Says a Michigan resident, veteran of the auto industry, and patriot. You can find her at @Irishyouwell on Twitter. She hails from a large Irish Catholic family and went for Trump before her republican brothers got there. She knew and was one of many early adopters.\nRepublican Voters, many cautious at first: We just didn\u2019t quite know how it would turn out. Trump admitted he donated to both sides as a business man, had friendly relationships with many democrats, and was known for many other controversies. Many nervously gave him their vote, because of the malevolence of Hillary. The outcomes are incontrovertible. SCOTUS picks, tax cuts, regulatory changes, etc \u2013 see the 53rd\u2019s Endorsement of President Trump for more. We\u2019ve got ourselves Reagan 2.0, modernized to deal with the swamp and the MSM Mudpit.\nBlack Americans in increasing numbers: #BLEXIT is real. Ask Leo Terrell aka Leo 2.0, who was sent over to the republican side by the violence and unrest engineered by the Pelosi/Soros/DNC cabal. At one time this was a small but powerful movement \u2013 it is gaining strength, size and momentum as Black Americans rediscover who really freed the slaves and stood for freedom throughout our history: The GOP. We are at the tip of the iceberg this year and the real % of the black vote that goes to the GOP is up for grabs. This writer asserts minimum 20% with a strong upside possibility. Trump\u2019s record is clear from the substantial (HBCU support, Prison Reform) to the Inspirational (pardons for Alice Johnson, Jon Ponder) despite MSM efforts to hide it.\nLatinos: that\u2019s right, Latinos. Here is a real quote from a friend of the writer, a Mexican Immigrant (Legal!) and entrepreneur on why he will be voting Trump: \u201cLaw & order, Anti-Abortion, Huge Balls and Jobs! and in addition, the wall. I know who comes across the border with and without the help of Coyotes. Trump was right on this from the beginning and it will help those on both sides of the border be safer. Finally \u2013 he\u2019s helping people get out of prison who maybe were unfairly sentenced.\u201d You can find him, \u2018Very Bad Hombre\u2019 on Twitter at @JoelOro71571807\nBoaters: who knew that boat parades were a thing? They are now. #KAG2020LandslideVictory\nCubans, Asians, Vietnamese, others escaping socialist/communist hellscapes: Maximo Alvarez, Cuban born business man and speaker at the GOP convention said it best: \u201cI am so grateful to America, the place where I was able to build my American dream through hard work and determination\u2026President Trump knows that the American story was written by people just like you and I, who love our country and take risks to build a future for our families and neighbors. I may be Cuban born, but I am 100-percent American. This is the greatest country in the world. I said this before. I gave away everything I have today, it would not equal 1 percent of what I was given when I came to this great country of ours: The gift of freedom.\u201d\nFactory Workers: having run successful businesses and having been raised walking construction sites, Donald Trump has an affinity for workers of all kinds. He relates. The term \u2018blue collar billionaire\u2019 is legit. Here\u2019s how Joe Biden relates to them:\n\u201cThis is not OK, alright?\u201d the man said, to which Biden replied, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that, pal, or I\u2019m going to go outside with you, man.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re working for me, man!\u201d the worker said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not working for you,\u201d Biden said. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a horse\u2019s ass.\u201d\nThat is real exchange  between Biden and Jerry Wayne, auto worker from Detroit. That says enough. In addition to sending their jobs to China, he doesn\u2019t even respect them personally. Even when he\u2019s not in the basement, Joe basically sucks.\nFreedom Caucus Republicans: it has been a long and painful process but they finally get it. Many of these types of republicans are well intended and worry about deficits and other matters of principle. They have netted out in favor of the little guy and now help the President move his agenda.\nGrandparents and parents of snowflakes and other assorted dead-enders, malcontents and under-achievers: every time they hear the words \u201cGo home to Mommy! and she\u2019s voting for Trump!\u201d \u2013 they know the Commander in Chief understands their predicament.\nLegitimate Democrats, abandoned by the DNC: unreported by the media, 30% of DNC delegates voted against the radical platform of the party, as espoused by the Squad. It is easy to infer that upwards of 30% of all democrats are not in favor of the party\u2019s current direction and many of them will vote for Trump out of sense of Patriotism. All of them? no. But like Black Americans, many will have their \u2018red pill\u2019 moment and vote GOP to save the republic.\nGay Americans: ask Brandon Straka who leads the #WalkAway movement. Some of the gay community is smart enough to know that the Biden/Obama admin let into our country millions of unscreened/unvetted Islamists that believe they should be thrown off buildings. Many are arming themselves and embracing safety, liberty, freedom and independence over woke/fascist social politics that never end. Another group that has discovered they are useful pawns for the democrat hate machine.\nNever Trumpers, the smart ones: they exist in shrinking numbers: a type of Rockefeller republican worried more about their portfolio than any notions of liberty or freedom. They have liberal friends and their social standing in urban settings is of utmost importance. They nod in agreement when points are made about Trump\u2019s boorish behavior. Many \u2013 as many as half \u2013 will secretly vote for him due to the excellent returns on their portfolios both before and now after, the pandemic first appeared. (Related: check out Glen Beck\u2019s recent apology to the Trump family on twitter) One thing this crowd may be starting to realize is that \u2018free trade\u2019 never was. We opened ourselves up to be raped and pillaged by allies and adversaries alike. Perhaps they are waking up.\nPeople of Faith: Christians of all stripes have embraced the President \u2013 not due to his personal past, but because of his stalwart commitment to religious freedom and life. He has delivered and is the most pro-life, or pro-afterlife as Sister Deirdre Byrne might say, President in our history. Jews should be increasingly in the President\u2019s camp \u2013 at least the ones who care in the slightest way about their faith and Israel. We will see in November if they join the Grand Coalition.\nDemocrat Mayors, the ones that are not dumb: they are starting to emerge and support the president in the open \u2013 see Minnesota \u2013 5 democrats and 1 independent have come out in support of the President for the difference he has made in their iron ore mining region. More to come.\nBikers, Truckers, Lobstermen, Fishermen, Loggers, Steelworkers, Oil Workers: all had their lives and incomes improve under Donald Trump \u2013 in most cases by him undoing executive actions from previous administrations that were arbitrary and unfair, and driven by special interests/lobbyists.\nVeterans and active duty troops: We know that Trump has fully funded the military for the first time in decades to include pay raises. We know the VA has gone through it\u2019s first real reform in decades. ISIS is gone. Troops will be redeployed or come home from stagnant areas where there are no results. We know our dead were returned form North Korea. We know POTUS is not the unstable war monger the MSM painted him as. He has our backs and does not set troops up for failure\nThe Digital Army: Trump has unleashed millions of patriots that help win the war against SleepyCreepy Joe and his Woke Dopes every single day: some you may want to follow and check out in addition to yours truly, @PershingSoldier, are: @Irishuwell @thro_e @PhilosophySeel @The53rdRegiment @abodon_5 @Svitoslav3 @PhillipDenton @SunshineLK10 @SmithsCoffeepot @cinco_d_mayo @DrRick32855962 @Red_Pilled_Day @eyeofseeing @patriot45Lynn @groth1945 @CrazyCatRescuer @BardakOrama @ArmyVet2x @usmc_army\nThese folks and many others keep it real, keep it funny, and keep it compelling. Check them out!\nWe close with a bit more from Michigan resident, @irishyouwell :\n\u201cOne of the most charming \u2013 yes charming! \u2013 characteristics of President Trump is his love of the nickname! He had me at \u2018Bad Eater,\u2019 for fake conservative and 24/7 sour puss, John Kasich. I have always been a \u2018nicknamer!\u2019 And having my parents and both sets of grandparents being native New Yorkers sealed the deal \u2013 an instant bond!\u201d\nI have to admit I  agree wholeheartedly with that assessment.\nWelcome to the Grand Coalition!\nBJP\nWas this post helpful?\nLet us know if you liked the post.

How did he achieve this?\nAnthony Zurcher, the BBC's North America correspondent, has tried to find an answer to that question.\nOnly a few people predicted that Donald Trump would run for office. But Mr. Trump decided to make a splash in the election. They predicted that his ratings would not be up. But this prediction did not come true either. They said he would not win the primaries election. Trump has coped with it, though. It was assumed that he would not be the unified Republican nominee, but Trump succeeded in doing so.\nAnd finally, it was argued that Trump would not win the election. But Donald Trump, who has defied all predictions, is already the president-elect.\nHere are 5 reasons for Trump's unexpected victory for many:\n!

The black and white working class in these states had been voting for Democrats for decades.\nBut in these elections, in particular, white workers with no higher education turned away from the party they traditionally supported. The villagers, who thought that the ruling circles, the political elite, did not pay attention to them, massively came to the polling stations, made their choice. So Virginia and Colorado supported Trump.\nFollowing this, voting in Wisconsin dashed Hillary Clinton's presidential hopes.\nMrs. Clinton garnered the most votes in places like California and New York. He faced the most decisive defeat in traditionally Republican states such as Utah.\nIn states that tend to support Trump, the Republican nominee's victory has been convincing.\n!

He also did not hesitate to enter into an argument with the Fox News channel and its popular presenter Megyn Kelly.\nBut as for the ironic comments about the beauty contest winner's weight, Trump declined to comment. He also apologized for his sexually-based comments against women.\nIt was felt that Donald Trump was poorly prepared for televised debates. But all of this passed as if ineffective in the Republican nominee.\nAlthough his rating dropped after the most unfortunate events, his level of support for Trump remained unchanged high.\nPerhaps the frequent raising of scandalous issues has weakened their effect. Regardless of the reasons, Trump's defense has not been able to be broken.\n! [ linea] (https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/640/mcs/media/images/75306000/jpg/_75306515_line976.jpg.webp)\nOutsider\n!

Mr. Trump doesn't need their help. Perhaps opposing party leaders is one of the reasons for Trump's success.\nDonald Trump has shown that he is different from the ruling circles by saying \u201call be rejected.\u201d It was a winning departure at a time when there were feelings of protest against the ruling circles.

Two weeks before the vote, FBI Director James Comey announced that a second investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of personal email while she was secretary of state was being launched.\nIt seems that after the first statement about the FBI's e-mail investigation, Trump managed to mobilize his constituents. In addition to securing the support of hardline detractors, he also deprived Clinton of the opportunity to deliver a compelling final message.\nNaturally, if Mrs. Clinton had used the State Department's e-mail system, this issue would never have come up.

But he got into the dispute. They also thought he wouldn't rise in the polls, much less win the Republican Party primaries. Who would bet that he would win a general election?\nBut the fact is that Trump just defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton and was elected president of the United States. Check out five reasons for your win.\n1. The white wave\n!

Ohio, Florida, and North Carolina voted for Trump.\nThe Democrats relied too much on their strength in the Midwest. These states were the party's stronghold for decades, in part because of the support of black voters and the white working class.\nBut working-class whites, especially those without a university education - men and women - abandoned the Democratic Party. Rural voters went to the polls in numbers and, like Americans who felt neglected by the system and left behind by the elite, made their voices heard.\nThe pro-Trump wave hit key states. And with strength.\n2. Shielding\n! [Scott Walker, Donald Trump, and Jeb Bush, then Republican candidates, during a debate in August] (https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/640/cpsprodpb/F900/production/_92344736_gettyimages-483201932.jpg.webp)\nCredit, Getty Images\nTrump insulted war veteran John McCain, a Republican senator. He got into a fight with journalist Megyn Kelly, an anchor for Fox News. He made a formal apology after a video leaked in which he made obscene comments about women.\nNone of that mattered. Although it fell in the polls after some controversy, its approval seemed shielded - rising again soon after.\nPerhaps the attacks were so hard and fast that no one had time to draw her blood. Perhaps Trump's personality and appeal were so strong that the scandals would end up being rebutted. Whatever the reason, the Republican proved to be bulletproof.\n3. The 'outsider'\n! [Posters and bibles are displayed at Trump's campaign event in Manchester on the eve of the election] (https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/640/cpsprodpb/8826/production/_92345843_trumpoutside.jpg.webp)\nCredit, AP\nHe ran against the Democrats in the election. But it also faced forces within the party itself. Trump hit everyone.\nThe Republican defeated his Republican opponents in the primaries. Some, such as Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie, and Ben Carson, eventually surrendered and came to support him. Others, such as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Ohio governor John Kasich, said they wouldn't support him.\nWhat about the other members of the party, like the mayor, Paul Ryan? Trump didn't need their help - and, in fact, he may have won the election because he was willing to stand up to bigwigs in his own party.\nIt is likely that Trump's stance has proven his independence and \u201coutsider\u201d status, at a time when a large part of the American population is upset with Washington (although not enough to prevent the return of most congressmen running for re-election).\nThat was a state of mind that some politicians captured - such as Democrat Bernie Sanders, for example, and Ted Cruz. Nobody, however, took more advantage of this than Trump, which earned him the White House.\n4. The Comey Factor\n! [James Comey, director of the FBI,] (https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/640/cpsprodpb/12F6/production/_92345840_comey.jpg.webp)\nCredit, Reuters\nThe polls did a regrettable job predicting electorate preferences, particularly in Midwestern states. In the final days of the campaign, however, polls showed that Trump was close enough to victory.\nThat trajectory didn't seem so obvious two weeks ago, before FBI Director James Comey announced that he was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was U.S. Secretary of State.\nIt is true that the dispute was getting tight, but it became more fierce after Comey's statements. Everything indicates that, during this period, Trump successfully consolidated his base, bringing back some conservatives and destroying Hillary's hopes of convincing voters in the final stretch of the campaign.\nOn the other hand, Comey's actions would never have  it was a factor if Hillary had relied on State Department email servers for her email exchanges. That weight now falls on your shoulders.\n5. Hurried instincts\n! [Donald Trump participates in campaign event in Nevada] (https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/640/cpsprodpb/6116/production/_92345842_trumpw5.jpg.webp)\nCredit, AP\nTrump led an unconventional campaign, but he showed that he knew more than the experts.\nHe spent more on hats than on research. He traveled to states like Wisconsin and Michigan, which analysts said were out of reach. He held mass rallies, instead of asking for votes from door to door.\nAll of these decisions - and many others - were ridiculed in \u201cexpert\u201d circles.\nIn the end, however, their strategies worked out. Trump and his closest allies - his children and some advisers - will laugh last. And they're going to do it at the White House.\nParticipate\nThe victory of the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, has divided opinions on social networks, further inflaming the controversies that marked the presidential campaign.\nDo you have any questions about why Trump was elected?

[Trump supporters] (https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/640/cpsprodpb/A663/production/_92359524_a38c6eec-7771-4c74-9bb3-545bc536d72f.jpg.webp)\nCredit, AP\nCertainly Brexit and Donald Trump's victory are the two events with the greatest international repercussions in 2016 - and perhaps the most impactful in recent times. But would they be, in a way, connected?\nThe comparison is compelling. Both the referendum that decided to leave the United Kingdom from the European Union and the Republican's victory surprised political and economic actors and a large part of public opinion.\nIn both analyses, polls, and the expectations of the international market were contradicted by popular vote. Also in common, the two events created uncertainty about the future of politics and the world economy.\nBut the comparisons go beyond the surprise factor and may indicate similar trends in two of the oldest representative democracies.\nHere are five factors that may connect Trump's triumph and the Brexit victory.\n1. Anti-immigration speech\n! [Latinos protest against Trump] (https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/640/cpsprodpb/3133/production/_92359521_hi036064365.jpgnew.jpg.webp)\nCredit, AP\nThe anti-immigration discourse had a major impact both in the Brexit campaign and in Trump's rhetoric - the resentment of an important part of the American population against foreigners and refugees was capitalized on by the Republican.\nPromises to deport 11 million illegal immigrants and to build a wall on the border with Mexico made the president-elect gain popularity with this group.\nConcerns about immigration and, in particular, about the free flow of European citizens were also determining factors for the mobilization of the British electorate that voted in favor of Brexit.\nThe slogan of \u201ctaking back border control\u201d was emphasized in the campaign conducted by Nigel Farage and other leaders of the movements to leave the European Union.\nLike several other analysts, Martin Sorrell, head of the multinational advertising firm WPP, sees immigration as a key factor in the choices of British and Americans.\nAccording to him, this topic \u201ctipped the voters' balance significantly\u201d.\n2. Disappointment with the management of the economy and reaction against globalization\n! [Stock exchange] (https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/640/cpsprodpb/212E/production/_92349480_30602c96-34c5-4e91-8533-cd6a6b86392f.jpg.webp)\nCredit, Getty Images\nDirector General of the World Trade Organization, Roberto Azev\u00eado, posted a series of messages on Twitter congratulating Donald Trump. And saying:\n\u201cIt's clear that many feel that commerce isn't working for them. We must face this and make sure that trade can bring greater benefits to most people,\u201d he wrote.\nThe message reflects the understanding that important sectors of the working class feel excluded by the globalization process - it is a feeling that is gaining strength both in the USA and in the United Kingdom.\nEspecially after the 2008 crisis, this section of the population has seen its earnings decline substantially, while traditional jobs move to emerging or developing countries.\nIn the United States, this population feels represented by Trump's speech, which promises to protect the American working classes and impose trade barriers.\nThe comparison with Brexit in this regard has already been suggested by David Axelrod, advisor to Barack Obama, in an article published in June. He pointed out that the same anti-globalization forces that propelled Brexit also supported the Trump campaign.\n\u201cThere is a fundamental aspect that all developed economies have to face, which is the fact that globalization and technological changes have marginalized millions of people, who have seen their salaries decrease,\u201d Axelrod wrote.\n! [Nigel Farage and Donald Trump] (https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/640/cpsprodpb/022D/production/_92375500_trumpfaragegetty.jpg.webp)\nCredit, Jonathan Bachman\nThe BBC analyst Mark Mardell, who has also compared the two phenomena, makes a reservation and says that this sentiment does not only affect those marginalized by globalization.\nAccording to him, it includes white workers without college education, the elderly, and those who live in the so-called rust belt, the region of the United States from which the factories moved, leaving a large part of the population without jobs or prospects.\n\u201cThat analysis isn't wrong, but it's not enough,\u201d Mardell wrote. \u201cThis is a simplistic narrative about the economy that doesn't do justice to the complexity of what happened over the past 30 years.\u201d\nAccording to him, economic and social inequality and people's insecurity are growing at a much faster pace than the economy itself or the general prospects for improvement.\n\u201cFew politicians dare to say (to the disappointed population) that automation is increasing The economy could take more jobs out of them than immigrants. You can't deport a truck guided by autopilot,\u201d he stresses.\nLarry Elliott, economics editor of the British newspaper The Guardian, also stated that part of the motivation for Brexit was the long-term evolution of economic policy.\n\u201cBrexit was more than a protest against job opportunities that never arrived or housing that wasn't built. It was a protest against the economic model that prevailed over the past three decades,\u201d he wrote in an article published in June.\n3. Research turned out to be wrong\n! [Disappointed voter] (https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/ws/640/cpsprodpb/CD73/production/_92359525_8ad5a3b5-4e08-44c5-a38a-141796c71411.jpg.webp)\nCredit, AP\nIf the vast majority of analysts and the polls were correct, Hillary Clinton would be the next president of the United States.\nBut Trump's victory is not a point off the curve. It represents one of the many failures in recent survey forecasts.\nAs the vote counts in the United States advanced, it became clear that the polls and projections that Trump would not win were wrong.\nThey failed to collect sufficient samples among white sectors without higher education. According to the American newspaper The New York Times, a large part of this electorate used to vote for the Democratic Party, and the polls failed to reflect that turn.\nThat group voted massively for Trump.\nMinority voting, including African-Americans and Americans of Hispanic origin, was overrated. In fact, that group supported Hillary, but not with the same intensity with which it voted for Obama four years ago.\nIn the case of Brexit, some initial polls even stated that there was an 88% probability that the United Kingdom would remain in the European Union.\nBut on the eve of the vote, they already indicated a tighter result - some pointed to a technical tie, with a slight advantage for remaining in the EU.\nAs in the United States, the counting of votes took everyone by surprise - including the international market.\n4. Electoral demography is similar\nAnalysts consider that both Brexit and the American elections saw the demonstration of a protest vote against the political class and the status quo.\nAnthony Zurcher, an analyst for the BBC, recalls that the states of the American Midwest, with a long tradition of democratic voting, voted in favor of Trump.\nThe New York Times points out that five of those states, which had voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, supported the Republican one. In all of them, white voters are the majority.\n!

Political and economic uncertainties\nThe similarities between the two choices also occur in relation to the uncertainties generated by the results.\nMost voters in both countries did not change their choice for fear of the unpredictable consequences of Brexit and Trump's victory for politics and the economy.\nThe Republican victory could mean a break with the free trade model of recent decades and indicate an era of economic protectionism.\nAlthough Brexit was not a vote for protectionism, the British voter accepted the risk of suffering consequences in this area, since the free trade pact is linked to other principles of the European Union, such as the free movement of people.\nBoth Brexit and Trump's victory pose a question mark on the management and trends of the international order.\nParticipate\nThe victory of the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, has divided opinions on social networks, further inflaming the controversies that marked the presidential campaign.\nDo you have any questions about why Trump was elected?

In the evening, the biggest and most attended event of her 19-month election campaign took place - there were about 33,000 people - in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the city where the Democratic Convention was also held: her husband, former president Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea and Michelle and Barack Obama took the stage with her, and then Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi performed. Clinton then concluded the election campaign with an event in Raleigh, North Carolina, together with Lady Gaga and again Bon Jovi.\nHillary Clinton's event in Pennsylvania",

        "text": "![](/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/7052-8_med.jpg)\nThat was one of many chants I remember from protesting the war in Vietnam and the draft. And the truth was, most of us didn\u2019t go. You could go the medical route like Donald Trump, AKA Cadet Bone Spurs, who managed to get a 1Y deferment after receiving four other student deferments. Or like many guys I knew, you could go the Bill Clinton route and get educational deferments like he did when he attended Georgetown and Oxford. Or you could join the National Guard like George W. Bush, where he allegedly played hooky and spent his service in Texas.\nHell no, we won't go. And the truth is most people I knew didn't end up in Vietnam.\nI don\u2019t blame them. No one I knew wanted to go. Some received deferments for teaching. Some stayed in college and then went to graduate school to delay the draft, hoping the war would end before they ran out of education. Attorneys, doctors, dentists, nurses, and veterinarians could put off serving until they finished their training. You could also join the Peace Corps or use a connection who knew someone on your local draft board. The point is, if your family had money, you were far less likely to be drafted.\nStill, the prospect of being drafted and sent to Vietnam had a huge impact on the lives of my generation. My husband was in medical school from 1967 to 1971. That meant he could put off his service until he received his M.D. and enter the army as an officer. To do this, he had to sign up for the Berry Plan, which many of his peers did. You could enter the army after finishing your internship year or after completing part of your residency. His friends who signed up never went to Vietnam, as the plan ended in 1973. But they did give two years of army service in remote locations in the United States, delaying the start of their careers and uprooting their families.\nMy husband rolled the dice despite receiving a frighteningly low number in the 1970 draft lottery. He gambled that the war would be over before he was drafted as a trained physician. Luckily, he guessed correctly. I was all set to pack up our infant son and flee to Canada if he was wrong. My younger brother spent a year \u201cstudying\u201d in Canada and would have stayed there. But 218 was a pretty safe number in the draft lottery, and he came back to the states the following year. You can look here to see what your fate would have been back then based on your birth date.\nSo, who did go to Vietnam aside from the fictional Jack Pearson on This is Us? Many of the boys I was teaching in my Basic English class back in 1967-68 ended up there because they lacked the grades to get into college. It wasn\u2019t the best time to be teaching high school English in that era. My students, both those on the track to be drafted into the war and those who were college-bound and able to avoid it, questioned the relevance of reading A Tale of Two Cities or learning about figures of speech. I didn\u2019t blame them. The war hung over our lives, and it was a war that made no sense to us. It definitely felt like the worst of times.\nCountry Joe and the Fish had a song that summed up the way we felt back then, I Feel Like I\u2019m Fixin\u2019 to Die Rag,\nCome on mothers throughout the land,\nPack your boys off to Vietnam.\nCome on fathers, and don\u2019t hesitate\nTo send your sons off before it\u2019s too late.\nAnd you can be the first ones in your block\nTo have your boy come home in a box.\nAnd it\u2019s one, two, three\nWhat are we fighting for?\nDon\u2019t ask me, I don\u2019t give a damn,\nNext stop is Vietnam.\nAnd it\u2019s five, six, seven,\nOpen up the pearly gates,\nWell there ain\u2019t no time to wonder why,\nWhoopee! we\u2019re all gonna die.\nIt was a bad time for our country, leading to a generational divide as fathers who had served in World War II debated with their sons who didn\u2019t want to serve in Vietnam. The Greatest Generation rejected their long haired, unpatriotic, draft-dodging kids. It was clearly a time of inequity in terms of who fought and who had the means to avoid service.\nCreating an all-volunteer army to fight our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan seems fairer on the surface than having a draft, but the result of who volunteers to serve now is still a reflection of the haves and have nots in our country. Without the threat of having to serve, the opposition to those wars was not as strong. The draft felt like a threatening cloud over our lives, but it also fueled the opposition to the war in Vietnam.\nI invite you to read my book Terribly Strange and Wonderfully Real and join my Facebook community.\n![Profile photo of Laurie Levy](https://www.myretrospect.com/wp-content/uploads/avatars/1385/5b4f320311f59-bpfull.jpg)\nBoomer.

        "text": "![](/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/aTrump.jpg)\nComing of age during the Vietnam War did not mean you would be automatically drafted. If you were a privileged white boy, as I was, those less fortunate often took your place.\nIn college, you could have used connections to get into the National Guard, as George W. Bush did to avoid active duty in Vietnam. Or you could have played the game of endless student deferments, as both Dick Cheney and Bill Clinton did. Or your friendly family doctor could claim you have some medical ailment making you unable to meet the military\u2019s physical and mental demands, as with \u201cbone spurs\u201d for Donald Trump.\nMy family doctor happened to be my father. Though temperamentally a Quaker and politically opposed to the Vietnam War, he was also a World War II veteran whose self-image was that of a responsible citizen. He would not help me get a spurious deferment. Also of no help was the fact that the head of the local Draft Board happened to be a tenant in one of my family\u2019s rental properties. In a small Southern town, where everyone would talk, \u201cpulling strings\u201d was not as risk-free as in the anonymity of a big city.\nIt was the summer after my college graduation, and my induction date in September still seemed far away. Still time, that is, to figure out what I was going to do. Working on a newspaper far away from home, I knew that teaching offered a deferment, so I stated applying (and got accepted) for positions in the upcoming fall semester at various private schools around the country. But the Selective Service notified me that it was too late to change my draft status. Only a medical deferment was actionable at this late date.\nSo it was I started seeing a psychiatrist. But I didn\u2019t tell him that I was seeking a mental health deferment. Instead, I rambled on about girlfriend problems and what\u2019s-the-meaning-of-life issues. Finally after about the third visit, he asked: \u201cTell me, what\u2019s the real reason you came to see me.\u201d I told him. Instead of kicking me out of his office, he launched into antiwar polemic that concluded thusly about going into the Army:\n\u201cIt takes more courage to say \u2018no\u2019 than to go.\u201d\nNot courageous enough to say \u2018no,\u2019 I soon found myself at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and Fort Gordon, Georgia, for induction and basic training. I think I was most afraid of family embarrassment (my uncle was a General) and social stigma. More nobly perhaps, I suspect I wanted to be a part of the common experience that would define my generation, just as World War II had defined my father\u2019s. The irony, of course, is that those figures from my generation most stigmatized, shunned, or \u201cSwift-boated\u201d by a large chunk of public opinion are precisely those who answered the call of duty \u2013 Al Gore, John Kerry, and now Robert Mueller.\nIs there a lesson here?\n![Profile photo of walter](https://www.myretrospect.com/wp-content/uploads/avatars/584/59cd1a49aac87-bpfull.jpg)",

        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Following Memorial Day, 'Deferment Donald' Trump went back to work launching a twitter strike against Marine Robert Mueller, claiming the Special Counsel's squad of prosecutors will be meddling in the midterm elections.\n\"The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!,\" tweeted Trump.\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is a REPUBLICAN. He was a REPUBLICAN when he was appointed by REPUBLICAN Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after Trump fired REPUBLICAN FBI Director James Comey.\nMueller was a REPUBLICAN when he was named Director of the FBI, by REPUBLICAN President George W. Bush, going on to being the longest-serving FBI Director since J. Edgar Hoover.\nMueller was a REPUBLICAN when Trump considered naming him his FBI Director.\nMueller was a REPUBLICAN when he served in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Vietnam War.\nMueller was a REPUBLICAN when he received medals for his actions in the Vietnam war, while Trump won a 'Yellow Heart' and 'Bronze Bone Spur Star' for obtaining FIVE DEFERMENTS.\nLast week, a reader asked in the comment section, what, if anything, Mueller's Russia investigation has produced?\nAs of the one year anniversary of Mueller being named Special Counsel, 19 people and 3 Russian companies have been indicted, and are facing trial, or plead guilty and are cooperating with Mueller's investigation.\nTrump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort has been indicted on multiple charges and is awaiting trial in Virginia.\nTrump's former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates has plead guilty to charges and is cooperating with Robert Mueller's investigation.\nTrump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has plead guilty to charges and is cooperating with Robert Mueller's investigation.\nTrump's attorney and 'fixer' Michael Cohen has had his home and offices raided. Cohen's business associate has plead guilty to charges and his cooperating with Department of Justice prosecutors.\nThe New York Times reported Tuesday evening that Trump's Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a key witness in Mueller's investigation of possible Trump obstruction of justice.\nThe NYT reported on a previously undisclosed meeting in which Trump reportedly pressured Sessions to take control of Mueller's investigation, despite Session having recused himself. It adds to the list of multiple occasions Trump bemoaned Session's recusing himself.\nJust as he did in Vietnam, Special Counsel Mueller is doing his job, honoring those who gave their lives fighting for and defending America's democratic principals, as 'Dishonest Donald' Trump dishonors the party of 'Honest Abe' Lincoln.",

        "text": "![](/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/golden-gate-bridge-1030999_640.jpg)\nMaybe I\u2019d breathed a little too much tear gas during anti-war demonstrations on the UC Berkeley campus\u2014or maybe it had to do with the direction my grades were headed\u2014but after one year I was convinced I wasn\u2019t ready to be a full-time college student. I needed time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I learned I could withdraw from the university and return after a year. After filing the necessary paperwork, I informed my parents. They were not overjoyed to hear the news.\nI found myself sitting next to women my age, or not much older, who were military wives. They came from the Midwest, the South and back East.....Their husbands were off fighting in Vietnam while these young wives held down a job, kept house, took care of the car, called the refrigerator repairman, paid the bills, and tried to stay sane.\n\u201cOnce a dropout, always a dropout,\u201d said my father, the teacher. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to school\u2014you have to find a job.\u201d There would be no break, no time to contemplate my future. He made that clear.\nI started my search for employment by circling ads in the newspaper for administrative assistants or entry-level clerks with \u201cgood people skills.\u201d No college degree required.\nGetting a job meant financial independence\u2014my primary goal. As soon as I found work and got a regular paycheck, I planned to move out of my parents\u2019 house. Most of my friends were already living away from home. They didn\u2019t have to whisper when their boyfriends called or suffer through the third degree after a date. They didn\u2019t have to listen to their parents argue. I was on the runway, ready for take-off. All I needed was a job.\nI believed I could find gainful employment despite my lack of typing skills\u2014or any other skills, for that matter. I knew I couldn\u2019t pass a typing test; I\u2019d never learned to touch type even though I took the silly class in high school. Typing presented a hurdle I couldn\u2019t get over, and most jobs required so many words a minute with no peeking.\nWhat I did have was a familiarity with three foreign languages, the belief that someone would hire me, and some cute interview outfits.\nDid I have a r\u00e9sum\u00e9? No.\nDid I have any previous work experience? Not unless you count occasional babysitting and teaching Sunday school.\nDid I have a plan? Yes. I would:\n- find companies eager to hire an eighteen-year-old inexperienced high school graduate with no marketable skills\n- fill out their applications; and\n- land a job\nI pulled on my pantyhose, put on some eyeliner, and went job hunting.\nI walked up and down the hills of San Francisco, into the high-ceilinged lobbies of shipping companies and offices I thought might have an international business angle. I filled out the applications and failed each typing test. After yet another promise from an unconvincing receptionist that she would keep my name on file, I consoled myself with rice pudding and coffee at the closest lunch counter. I was beginning to lose faith in my plan.\nFive weeks later, thanks to a timely word from a friend of my sister, I got the inside track for a job as a telephone operator with Ma Bell\u2014the phone company. I aced the entrance test (no typing required), filled out the application, went home, and waited for a phone call. I didn\u2019t wait long to hear the news: I would begin my new job as a long-distance operator in downtown San Francisco by the end of the year.\nMy building was in the financial district. The operators sat in front of consoles, two by two, in long rows. Trainees went into a small glassed-in room just off the main floor. We could hear the low voices all around us. \u201cGoodmorningmayIhelpyou?\u201d\nAll the new hires went through several days of training and role playing. We were given a script to follow. We had to learn a variety of procedures that involved multitasking, before multitasking was a thing. I got freaked out the first day, worried that I would never learn the right way to do everything at the same speed as the veterans out on the floor.\nWe were not encouraged to improvise or inject our personalities into our calls. If it wasn\u2019t in the script, we didn\u2019t say it. (With one exception: when our union, the Communication Workers of America, called for a walkout, we had to come up with something to say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, but the operators are going on strike. Can you please try your call again later?\u201d)\nAfter a couple of paychecks, I moved into my sister\u2019s apartment in Berkeley. We shared the rent and took turns cooking. I commuted to the city by bus five days a week in my miniskirts and platform shoes or maxi skirts and boots, accessorized with dangling bead earrings I\u2019d made myself; not quite a full-fledged hippie, but close. I stopped for a danish on the way to work almost every day, snuck in quick shopping trips at lunch, and had a slice of cafeteria cherry pie on my afternoon break. I usually fell asleep on the bus ride home.\nI found myself sitting next to women my age, or no t much older, who were military wives. They came from the Midwest, the South and back East. As a Bay Area native, I felt like the odd one out. Their husbands were off fighting in Vietnam while these young wives held down a job, kept house, took care of the car, called the refrigerator repairman, paid the bills, and tried to stay sane. I learned about their struggles to be competent\u2014but not too competent\u2014 so the men wouldn\u2019t suspect their wives were becoming totally self-sufficient.\nPatty from Michigan came to work wearing knee-length skirts, heels, and pearls, with her hair in a French twist. Patty\u2019s husband had been gone for a year, and she was used to being in charge of her life. She was brisk about her work and confident in her manner. Once we got to be friends, she shared some of her \u201chow to make a man happy\u201d tips. I blushed; she didn\u2019t.\nBefore a brief R&R in Hawaii with her husband, the Army gave Patty her orders: \u201cNo trouble, no arguments, no nagging. You know what your job is.\u201d Shortly after she returned to work, she got a letter from her husband: he wanted a divorce. We rallied around her as she fought back her tears, clutching the letter in her fist. She\u2019d gone so far to see him and tried so hard to follow instructions, but they got into a fight about changing the oil in the car or some damn thing, and that set him off. After a couple of weeks he cooled down and apologized.\nI had been paired in training with Trina, who came from a small town in Texas. We were the same age. She was quiet and shy, and wore skirts and sweater sets or simple dresses to work. Her wicked sense of humor surprised me. Before her husband shipped out, he gave her strict instructions: she could not go out at night, she was not to associate with any hippies, and she must sleep with a gun under her pillow for protection. Trina broke two of his rules with me as an accomplice: one night after work she went to the movies\u2014and the hippie friend she wasn\u2019t supposed to have (me) went along with her. I\u2019d also accepted her offer to stay over after the movie, but I wished she\u2019d told me about the gun before I said yes. As it was, I didn\u2019t get much sleep.\nI told Trina I thought it was unusual to get married so young. None of my friends were even thinking about it. I couldn\u2019t imagine being married at our age. Why would you, when you could just live together? She said the girls in her senior class posed for their yearbook pictures with their left hands touching their right shoulders so their engagement rings would show. Then she pulled out a drawer and showed me the baby clothes\u2014for when she and her husband started a family. I looked at the little sweaters and booties and considered how different our lives were. Trina knew what her future looked like: Texas, kids, marriage, keeping house. Her life seemed set out in front of her like a long stretch of blacktop.\nI still had no idea what my life would look like. Would I go back to school? Or would I keep eating too many baked goods while stuck in a dead-end job, drifting along through life, continuing to disappoint my father? Was the answer really blowin\u2019 in the wind? Where was my plan? I\u2019m not saying I envied them\u2014married already, with big responsibilities\u2014but I felt nowhere near as grown-up as my co-workers. I hadn\u2019t expected to feel that way. I\u2019d been to college after all. I was smart, wasn\u2019t I? Why didn\u2019t I feel more like an adult?\nI\u2019d never expected to get to know people like Patty and Trina and the others: they came from small conservative communities, had strong religious beliefs, and were shocked to find themselves living in the same city as the Haight-Ashbury, home of the fizzled Summer of Love. I\u2019m sure I was a curiosity to them also. A Jewish girl. From Berkeley. Not married or engaged at nineteen, on the Pill, free to come and go with no one telling me how to behave, dreaming of bigger things, making my own plans. Or not. It felt like freedom to me. But I\u2019d been living in the Berkeley bubble. Hippies were cool, straights were the enemy. The war in Vietnam was wrong and no one should have to be there. Hell no, we won\u2019t go. Make Love Not War.\nStill, even guys in Berkeley were required to register for the draft when they turned eighteen. There was a lottery every year, and each young man got a draft number based on his date of birth. The day the numbers were published in the newspaper, I ran my finger down the columns until I found my boyfriend\u2019s number. It was high\u2014356. I was relieved to know where he stood, even though he had a college deferment and wasn\u2019t going to be drafted. I didn\u2019t mention my boyfriend\u2019s draft number at work that day, and no one asked me about it. I was aware that Trina and Patty and others had husbands who were risking their lives in a war I had marched in the streets to protest. I was against the war, not against those men. I knew their names and where they were from. Their wives were my friends.\nThis was a gap year for me, a time away from school, working to s upport myself and feeling independent. I thought it would be a break from my education, but I actually learned more than I\u2019d bargained for, spending my days alongside women who were dealing with real life and real problems. You wouldn\u2019t have called my friends liberated, but you would have called them women. And despite my show of independence, next to them I still felt like a girl.\nI don\u2019t even remember what I learned in my Sociology of Women class, but by talking to my work friends I came to see how women can adapt to difficult roles with strength, courage and dignity. What they knew didn\u2019t come from reading a textbook. My friends\u2019 lives were real, much more real than mine. They had jumped into the adult worlds of work and family life, and didn\u2019t waver from that path\u2014at least not when I knew them, when we were all young. From them I learned that marriage means commitment. The vows they took weren\u2019t always easy to stand by, but they did it. Marriage seemed less like a someday possibility and more like something I wanted for myself one day.\nBefore I became friendly with the women at work, Vietnam seemed a world away. The issues were black and white. War was wrong and we were right. But as I got to know my friends better, something changed. I still didn\u2019t support the war, but I did support my friends as they took care of business, treading lightly with their absent husbands to keep the peace at home, wise beyond their years.\n.",

        "description": "Although Robert Mueller is a Vietnam veteran, a viral photograph doesn't actually show the former FBI director during the war.",
        "text": "As speculation heated up in late 2017 that President Donald Trump was going to fire special counsel Robert Mueller from his position leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, Internet users started sharing memes claiming to compare the men's integrity. For instance, an image purportedly showing Robert Mueller serving in the Vietnam War (left) was frequently shared next to photographs of Donald Trump (right), who received multiple deferments exempting him from the draft:\nThe image of President Trump is real. According to Business Insider, it was taken from the New York Military Academy's 1964 yearbook and showed Trump with (not pictured) \"his fellow intramural bowling team staffers.\" The photograph purportedly showing Mueller, however, doesn't actually show the former FBI Director during the war.\nRobert Mueller truly did serve in the Vietnam War, where his distinguished service as a Marine earned a Bronze Star, the Purple Heart and other decorations. A 2001 profile from Time Magazine reported that Mueller joined the Marines in 1968 and served as the Commander of a rifle platoon of the 3rd Marine Division:\nIn 1968, while others of his generation were attempting to avoid the draft, Mueller enlisted in the Marine Corps. After officer candidate school, Army Ranger School and Army jump school, he shipped out to Vietnam, where he commanded a rifle platoon. Toward the end of his tour he became aide-de-camp to the commanding general of the Third Marine Division. He was awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, two Navy Commendation Medals and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry.\nMilitary.com provided some more information about Mueller's service:\nWhat was even stranger \u2014 he didn't curse, at least in front of them \u2014 and that was decidedly uncommon for a Marine. They also said that he was \"solid,\" and knew how to listen. And they also liked that he was a \"Mustang\" \u2014 he had enlisted out of Princeton and gone through Parris Island boot camp just like them, and then through Officer Candidate School.\nMueller would earn the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry in his time in Vietnam. The citation for his Bronze Star said that during an attack on his rifle platoon, \"2nd Lt. Mueller fearlessly moved from one position to another, directing the accurate counterfire of his men and shouting words of encouragement to them.\"\nDuring the firefight on Dec. 11, 1968, Mueller \"personally led a fire team across the fire-swept terrain to recover a mortally wounded Marine who had fallen in a position forward of the friendly lines,\" the citation said.\nMueller certainly served in the Vietnam War. However, he is not the man featured in this photograph. This image actually shows Ed Episcopo, a Vietnam veteran who served in the 25th Infantry Division. The photograph was included in a Flickr album documenting Episcopo's time in Vietnam. All of the photographs were taken on a \"$12 Kodak Instamatic cartridge camera,\" in his words, before being scanned and processed with modern software:\nEpiscopo confirmed to us that he was the soldier in the photograph:\nYes, the soldier in the photo is me. I was 19 years old and I was serving with the 25th Infantry Division in Vietnam. I had just returned from a night ambush patrol. I probably just handed my $12 Instamatic film camera to a squad member to take the photo. My family was always asking me to send photos.\nObservant viewers may had already determined that the man in the photograph was not Mueller by noting the rank insignia on his uniform. The pictured soldier has a single chevron and rocker on his left sleeve, indicating the Army rank of private first class (PFC). Mueller, on the other hand, was a commissioned Marine officer who served as second lieutenant leading a rifle platoon. Although we have not been able to find any pictures of Mueller during his time in Vietnam, he was likely wearing a single bar on his collar.",

Viral pics are old\nFollowing Qatar's recent decision to reverse the original plan for tournament sponsor Budweiser to sell beer to fans attending the FIFA World Cup 2022, there are several people claiming on social media that beer cans are being disguised as soft drink cans and being snuck into the football stadiums.\nListen to Story\nIndia Today Fact Check\nBoth photos are old and not related to the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. No recent incident of people getting caught with disguised beer cans has been from Qatar so far.\nFrom the very beginning, the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar has been at the centre of controversies. Be it the host's orthodox views on homosexuality, or the treatment of migrant workers who constructed the necessary infrastructure for the event, Qatar has continued to make headlines over the past couple of months.\nFollowing Qatar\u2019s recent decision to reverse the original plan for tournament sponsor Budweiser to sell beer around the eight sites, two photos have started making rounds on social media that purportedly show beer cans disguised as soft drink cans.\nPeople who shared these two photos claimed that football fans were sneaking beer inside the stadium by adding fake Pepsi or Coca-Cola covers to the cans.\n\"Football lovers finding ways to drink alcohol at the Fifa world cup in Qatar. Fans rebrand Heineken beer cans as Pepsi in other to smuggle to the stadiums and other places after last-minute ban on alcohol by Qatari Authorities,\" read one such post.\nAnother such tweet read, \"Some supporters have obviously found the technique to drink alcohol in stadiums in Qatar.\"\nSome supporters have obviously found the technique to drink alcohol in stadiums in Qatar. \u00f0\u00f0\u00ba pic.twitter.com/KqaLlHsfpy \u2014 World Cup Updates (@wc22updates) November 20, 2022\nAt the same time, some people also claimed that a few fans are nabbed by the administration when they tried to sneak beer inside the stadium using the same technique.\nIn Qatar fans who are not allowed to enter the stadium with beer at the World Cup are being caught trying to enter the stadium with Pepsi stickers in this form. It should be noted that Qatar prohibits any alcoholic beverages. pic.twitter.com/JfRViRffTR \u2014 Der-daba (@derdaaba8) November 23, 2022\nA website called Dimsum Daily also reported hat football fans were purchasing silicone can covers to disguise beer cans as Coca-Cola after alcohol sale at Qatar World Cup stadiums was banned. The story featured one of the viral photos.\nAFWA's investigation found that both photos are old and not related to the ongoing FIF World Cup in Qatar.\nAFWA PROBE\nUpon reverse-searching the first photo \u2014 Heineken cans covered with fake Pepsi wrapping \u2014 we came across multiple news reports from 2015. One such report from the Newser published on November 13, 2015, featured the same image.\nPer the report, a smuggler was held by Saudi Arabia's custom department, who allegedly tried to smuggle 48,000 cans of Heineken beer \u2014 all disguised as Pepsi cans. Reportedly, the man got busted while transporting the can into Saudi Arabia via the Al Batha border. Alcohol is banned in Saudi Arabia.\nWe also found the archived version of a tweet made by the official account of the Customs Department of Saudi Arabia from November 11, 2015. The tweet contained the same image, making it clear that it had nothing to do with this ongoing World Cup.\nWhen we reverse-searched the second photo and found it on various social media sites. Some shared it as early as six months before the World Cup began. For instance, an Instagram user shared this photo on June 9 with the caption, \"Just little things like this.\"\nThe same photo was also shared by a Twitter account on June 7. A Dailystar report, however, mentioned that this photo was shot in the UK this summer.\nWe also searched for news reports to make sure if any similar incidents had been reported from Qatar recently and found any credible ones. Although we could not pinpoint the exact date or place where this Coca-Cola-wrapped beer can photo was shot, we are more than sure that neither is related to the ongoing FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\nPlease share it on our at 73 7000 7000\nYou can also send us an email at factcheck@intoday.com",

        "text": "There is a photograph of an \u201castronaut\u201d carved in a 16th century Spanish cathedral in Salamanca. Known as the Catedral Nueva, the entrance fa\u00e7ade of this cathedral features a strange modern figure who appears to be an astronaut wearing a helmet.\nThis picture, circulating the internet, could easily cause someone to pause and even rethink their position on the validity of ancient aliens.\nHowever, this spacesuit, complete with tubes and boots, shows an accurate depiction of what a man in space would be outfitted with. And the picture is not fiction or fabrication.\nThe Catedral Nueva, or \u2018New Cathedral\u2019 is not new at all, as is the way of many churches in European cities. It\u2019s a building project that started back in 1513, and was interrupted by various events, including the Lisbon earthquake of 1755.\nCathedral of Salamanca is actually two churches joined together, one dates back to the 12th\u201213th centuries, while the newer one dates back to the 16th century.\nSalamanca\u2019s biggest and loveliest surprise is its enclosed Main Square. Dating from the 18th century, it\u2019s a marvel of sandstone that seems to have survived intact, rather like the Place de Vosges in Paris. Up to 150 years ago, they would have had an unsettlingly fine view of the bullfights that took place in the plaza below. A bull\u2019s head in stone still protrudes over one of the exits from the square to signal the fact.\n![View of Cathedral of Salamanca, Castilla y Leon region, Spain.](https://arkeonews.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/View-of-Cathedral-min.jpeg)\nSalamanca is one of three university cities close to Madrid that attracts visitors interested in culture and particular places of veneration.\nAs with most pictures that circulate the internet making weird claims, there is a deeper story behind the carving on Catedral Nueva and it doesn\u2019t involve aliens at all.\nAccording to reports, the astronaut carvings were included only recently; in fact they were only included in 1992, and not the 12th or 16th century.\nWhile it is true that Catedral Nueva\u2019s construction began in 1513, under the order of King Ferdinand, married to the famous Queen Isabella, there was no such carving at the time of the project\u2019s completion.\n![](https://arkeonews.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/famous-astronaut-carved-stone-salamanca-cathedral-facade-spain-min.jpeg)\nOne of the artists, Jeronimo Garcia, who was responsible for working on the project, decided that he would add a personal touch to the work and decided to include two sculptures that were modern in creation.\nThe explanation for why an astronaut was selected was because it was a symbol of the 20th century when one of the greatest accomplishments of mankind was achieving space flight and landing on the Moon.\nThat is not all, as the artist even included figure of a dragon eating an ice-cream, a lynx, a bull, a stork, a rabbit, and a crayfish.\nIt can be fun to look into concepts like the ancient astronauts theory, but most of the time, there are far more plausible explanations than the idea that aliens once roamed the Earth, inspiring people to carve statues of them into cathedrals.",

        "description": "Rumor: Photographs show the figure of an astronaut carved into the wall of a 12th century Spanish cathedral.",
        "text": "Erich von D\u00e4niken's 1968 book Chariots of the Gods? posited that elements of the religions and technologies developed by some of Earth's oldest civilizations were actually the products of extraterrestrial visitations by space travelers whom those ancient Earthlings welcomed as gods. Among the types of evidence von D\u00e4niken offered in support of his thesis was his interpretations of ancient artworks as depicting extraterrestrial beings and forms of technological activity that were not realized until the 20th century (such as astronauts and vehicles traveling through air and space).\nChariots of the Gods? has long since been dismissed by most scientists and archaeologists as containing far more pseudoscience than actual science, but fascination with some of the ideas it expressed remains \u2014 as evidenced by the example reproduced above, which claims that a cathedral wall in Spain dating from the 12th century bears the mysterious, unexplainable likeness of an astronaut carved by a stonemason over 900 years ago:\nHere is a Mystery! See if you can suggest an answer\nIn the Spanish City of SALAMANCA the Cathedral there was built in 1102\nI have asked my work colleagues if this item is TRUE ... and they assure me that it is INDEED (and nobody has an answer)\nThere is a small detail carved into the masonery which amazes everyone that sees it...\nCan You Suggest how a 20th Century Astronaut came to be carved by a 12th Century Stonemason?\nFirst off, the example errs a bit in identifying the astronaut carving as adorning the wall of a cathedral built in 1102. The city of Salamanca in Spain is home to two adjacent cathedrals: The \"Old Cathedral\" (Catedral Vieja), begun in the 12th century, and the \"New Cathedral\" (Catedral Nueva), begun in the 16th century. The figure in question is part of latter, not the former. Still, finding this carving of an astronaut on the wall of a cathedral constructed between 1513 and 1733 would be quite remarkable, as the figure anticipates with amazing accuracy a form of technology not realized until centuries later.\nUnfortunately for Chariot buffs, however, the origins of the carving are neither ancient nor mysterious. The astronaut figure dates not from the 12th century or the 16th century or even the 18th century, but from 1992, and we know both who put it there and why: The New Cathedral was undergoing restoration work during that period, and one of the artisans engaged in the project chose to engage in a bit of tradition by \"signing\" his work with a contemporary symbol representative of the 20th century: an astronaut.\nA Portuguese article about the restoration of Salamanca's New Cathedral explains (as best we can translate it into English) that:\nThe restoration of the Cathedral of Salamanca in 1992 integrated modern and contemporary motifs, including a carved figure of an astronaut. The use of this motif was in the tradition of cathedral builders and restorers including contemporary motifs among older ones as a way of signing their works. The person responsible for the restoration, Jeronimo Garcia, chose an astronaut as a symbol of the twentieth century.",

It almost seems as if there is an unspoken rule that naps are mandatory as a means of rejuvenation to run the country.\nThe term \"sleepists\" was coined by Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).

Bay Street remained closed.\nIn a post on Facebook, the organization said Ukraine is under a \u201crelentless attack from Russia.\u201d\n\u201cWe cry out to everyone who cares about democracy and freedom to come out in support and in solidarity with Ukraine,\u201d the post reads.\nPeter Schturyn, President of the Ukrainian-Canadian Congress, said the goal of the march is to \u201crally all Canadian Ukrainians, along with the Toronto community (to) stand together (and) stand for our brothers and sisters in Ukraine.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here wanting Russia to stop its useless, senseless, horrific war with a nation that wants nothing but peace,\u201d he said.\nSchturyn said the demonstrations in Toronto are going to continue \u201cuntil every inch of Ukrainian territory is back in Ukrainian hands.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re fighting until the very end, and so are we,\u201d he said.\n- Accused took the wheel \u2018minutes\u2019 before fatal Ontario boat crash, court hears\n- Ford plans to table law to eliminate internal trade barriers, pushes Ring of Fire work\n- Man arrested after allegedly random fatal attack against unhoused person in downtown Toronto\n- Ontario man says he is owed $60K for 14 months of unpaid rent\nSchturyn said the \u201ctide of the war is changing.\u201d\n\u201cThe pendulum is swinging back,\u201d he said. \u201cUkrainians are fighting harder than ever before.\u201d\nHe said the \u201cwhole country is up in arms, standing shoulder-to-shoulder.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n![For news impacting Canada and around the world, sign up for breaking news alerts delivered directly to you when they happen.](https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/images/skyline/national.jpg)\nGet breaking National news\nSchturyn said what Ukraine needs immediately is a no-fly zone to be declared over its airspace.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unprecedented, the West has done that for other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done if for Libya, they\u2019ve done it in former Yugoslavia. They\u2019ve done it once for Israel.\u201d\nOla Holyk is an elementary school teacher in Mississauga.

        "description": "A photograph of a man kneeling before a priest was widely shared on Twitter and Facebook.",
        "text": "In August 2020, social media users circulated a photograph meme said to depict a priest giving the last rites to a Cuban farmer who was being executed because he \"refused to work for the Castro regime\":\nThis image was indeed a Pulitzer Prize winner for United Press International (UPI) photographer Andrew Lopez in 1960, who snapped a series of four photographs of a man executed by a Fidel Castro firing squad, of which this picture was one. However, some of the other accompanying details in this meme are not quite accurate.\nFulgencio Batista was the military dictator of Cuba from 1952 until the end of 1958, when he was overthrown by forces led by Castro and his allies during the Cuban Revolution. This photograph does not depict a \"farmer [who] refused to work for the Castro regime,\" but rather a member of Batista's army who had been charged as a war criminal by the victorious revolutionaries a few weeks after they finally ousted Batista.\nThe UPI caption for this picture read as follows: \"Father Domingo Lorenzo performs last rites for Cuban Army Cpl. Jose Cipriano Rodriguez on Jan. 17, 1959. Rodriguez, who had served in Fulgencio Batista's army, was executed by firing squad after being found guilty for the deaths of two brothers. His tribunal lasted just one minute.\"\nA UPI account of the circumstances behind the photograph, which was published in May 1960 when Lopez was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, stated that Rodriguez's trial lasted two hours rather than four minutes (although deliberations afterwards lasted only a minute), and it made no mention of Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara, a Castro lieutenant, being personally involved in the case (although Guevara reviewed the appeals and firing squad sentences of those convicted as war criminals in post-revolutionary Cuba):\nAndrew Lopez, veteran United Press International photographer, felt like crying when he took his Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs of a Cuban war criminal kneeling before a priest, with an impatient firing squad watching.\nLopez was awarded the prize for a series of four photographs of Cpl. Jose (Pepe Caliente) Rodriguez preparing to die.\n\"When you have a man kneeling, being given spiritual consolation by a priest who is holding a cross in his hand as the victim presses forward to kiss it, there's no question,\" Lopez said.\n\"It was packed with emotion. I felt like crying myself,\" he said.\nRodriguez was sentenced Jan. 17, 1959, after a two-hour trial in San Severino fortress near Matanzas, Cuba. The tribunal conferred for one minute before finding him guilty, Lopez said. Rodriguez was marched from the trial room and taken down a flight of stairs to the courtyard.\n\"When I saw him marching down the stairs I went in front of him and into this huge, open air, dungeon-like area,\" Lopez said. \"I started to make pictures.\n\"When Pepe Caliente fell to his knees as a priest held up a cross for him to kiss, the scene was one that will be hard to forget. I honestly felt like crying ...\n\"While all this was going on, the firing squad in the background impatiently was waiting for this scene to end so they could perform their duty.\"\nThe condemned man received a 24-hour stay just before sentence was to be carried out, but he was shot the next day.",

        "text": "A graphic shared on Facebook shows a black-and-white photo of kneeling man, clasping a small crucifix, while a man dressed as a priest in a long black robe bends down to speak to him. Heavily armed men look on.\nText above the photo reads: \u201cThis picture won the Pulitzer Prize in 1960. It shows a priest giving the last rites to a Cuban farmer, owner of his land. He refused to work for the Castro regime. He died by a firing squad after a \u2018trial\u2019 by Che Guevara that lasted 4 minutes. You will never see this picture on a T-shirt.\u201d\nThe caption refers to the photos of Che Guevara often reproduced on t-shirts. Guevara was an Argentinian communist who was prominent in the Cuban revolution of the late 1950s and other leftist guerilla campaigns in South America.\nThe graphic is also shared here and here. It was flagged as possibly false by Facebook\u2019s fact-checking system after it was posted in South Africa.\nBut is this the true story behind the photo?\nPhoto won 1960 Pulitzer prize\nAn online search for the phrase \u201cphoto that won Pulitzer prize in 1960\u201d reveals that the image did win the Pulitzer Prize for photography in 1960 \u2013 or rather, the photographer Andrew Lopez won the prize for the photo.\nThe Pulitzer prizes are prestigious annual awards in 21 different categories across journalism, literature and music given out almost exclusively to US citizens.\nThe caption to the photo on the Pulitzer website says that the man in the photo was a former corporal of \u201cBatista\u2019s army\u201d. He was receiving his last rites before his execution, a Catholic ritual performed by a priest before death.\nFulgencio Batista was a dictator who ruled Cuba twice, for the second time between 1952 and 1959. An army under Fidel Castro and Guevara fought and eventually won against Batista\u2019s rule.\nThese details about the photo were repeated on the Pulitzer Prizes Facebook page on 1 December 2016 when they republished the photo. The caption adds that the photo was taken \u201cmoments before he is to be executed by a Fidel Castro firing squad\u201d.\nTribunal lasted \u2018just one minute\u2019\nAccording to United Press International (UPI), who Lopez worked for, the famous photo was taken on 17 January 1959. They also add details about the man executed, Jose Cipriano Rodriguez.\nUPI say: \u201cRodriguez, who had served in Fulgencio Batista's army, was executed by firing squad after being found guilty for the deaths of two brothers. His tribunal lasted just one minute. UPI photographer Andrew Lopez won the 1960 Pulitzer Prize for a series of four photos from the scene, including this one.\u201d\nNone of the sources we found mentioned that Guevara was directly involved in Rodriguez\u2019s tribunal. And Rodriguez was a senior military officer, not a farmer. But he was executed by Cuban communist forces, after they defeated Batista\u2019s army.\nRepublish our content for free\nFor publishers: what to do if your post is rated false\nA fact-checker has rated your Facebook or Instagram post as \u201cfalse\u201d, \u201caltered\u201d, \u201cpartly false\u201d or \u201cmissing context\u201d.

Please wait.\nPublished byAgatha Neal Modified over 9 years ago\n1\nPower & Politics: Making Laws\n2\nMaking Laws One of the most important things Parliament does is make laws. Before one can be made, someone has to have the idea: whatever could have led them to some of these?\n3\nUnusual Laws in France it\u2019s illegal to call a pig Napoleon.\n4\nUnusual Laws in Ohio it\u2019s illegal to get a fish drunk.\n5\nUnusual Laws In Kentucky it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon more than six feet long.\n6\nUnusual Laws in England all men aged over 14 must do two hours of longbow practice a day.\n7\nUnusual Laws in Vermont a married woman must get her husband\u2019s written permission before she may wear false teeth. \u201cDarling, I found them...\u201d\n8\nUnusual Laws in York it\u2019s legal to murder a Scotsman inside the city walls, but only if he\u2019s carrying a bow & arrows (like this one).\n9\nUnusual Laws in London it\u2019s illegal to flag down a taxi if you have the plague.\n10\nUnusual Laws in Florida unmarried women who parachute on Sundays can be jailed.\n11\nUnusual Laws in San Salvador drunk drivers may be put in front of a firing-squad.\n12\nUnusual Laws in Lancashire if a police officer on the seashore has asked you not to incite a dog to bark, & you do, you\u2019re breaking the law.\n13\nUnusual Laws in Indonesia the penalty for masturbation is decapitation.\n14\nMaking Laws so how does an idea become law in the UK? Let\u2019s find out.\n15\n1. Drafting the Bill at the beginning the new law is called a draft bill. It has to be drafted (written) very carefully in case any mistakes make it impossible to enforce later.\n16\n2. First Reading at the First Reading the government tells everyone in Parliament that this is what they intend to do.\n17\n3. Second Reading this time the bill is explained; Parliament is able to debate reasons for & against passing it, & a vote is taken on whether it should be dropped or carry on its way through the process.\n18\n4. Committee Stage a group of MPs then examines the bill in detail & suggests changes (which both the House of Commons & the House of Lords must agree on).\n19\n5. Report Stage the Committee prepares a report on the bill & explains any changes that have been made.\n20\n6. Third Reading the bill is read for a 3 rd time in Parliament; changes may be made, & there is another vote to see if the House wants the bill to become law.\n21\n7. The other House a bill passed by the House of Commons must be passed by the House of Lords as well, & vice versa; changes must be agreed by both Houses too.\n22\n8. Royal Assent the Queen must also agree to the bill, & when she does, it becomes law. it may take place immediately, or be delayed to get people used to the new idea & make necessary preparations.\n23\nCurrent laws a few of you please suggest some laws we have now; they\u2019ll go on the board, & we\u2019ll see if you think them fair or unfair (& to whom).\n24\nTask now, in 3s or 4s, get together to create six laws of your own, three sensible & three more unusual\u2026 one group member needs to make sure everyone gets their say. consider why your law is needed (what problem is it trying to solve?) consider what problems / loopholes there could be with your law consider what punishment there should be for breaking your law\n25\none group\u2019s ideas: Sensible laws: compulsory National Service raise minimum wage more time at school to replace homework microchip babies at birth death for murderers/paedos to free up prison space study fashion at school Not-so sensible laws: compulsory kisses on Valentine\u2019s Day legal to drive a car at age 14 dogs give permission to go kayaking every Tuesday & Thursday no parents\u2019 evenings\n26\nanother group\u2019s ideas: Sensible laws: don\u2019t microwave your hamster obese people to be fired no motor vehicles to be used on a Sunday no bestiality anyone can run for Prime Minister drug addicts to be executed Not-so sensible laws: don\u2019t make explosives for your animals all ugly people to be shot everything in shops is to be free condoms to be worn on the head go to the toilet on Tuesdays only\n27\nThe vote each group may now present one bill the rest of us will vote on whether or not to make it into law\n28\nWe need\u2026 three sensible laws three silly laws in a PowerPoint (ideally) illustrated (take pictures from the Web) save to two computers (in case someone in your group\u2019s away next week)\nSimilar presentations\n\u00a9 2025 SlidePlayer.com Inc.\nAll rights reserved.",

        "description": "Image won the Pulitzer Prize in 1960, but it circulates out of context on the networks",
        "text": "A photo showing a Cuban soldier from the defeated Fulgencio Batista regime moments before he was shot circulates on social media out of its original context. On Facebook, the image was posted with a caption stating that the man portrayed is a peasant who was killed while refusing to work for the Fidel Castro regime. A version of the post was shared 10,000 times. Identical posts were also found on Twitter and were checked by agencies from other countries.\n\u201cThat photo won the Pulitzer (Prize),\u201d the caption of the post reads. \u201cA priest giving the last blessing to a Cuban peasant, landowner, who refused to work for the Fidel Castro regime, and who was convicted by \u201cChe\u201d, without the right to defense, to die by shooting. You'll never see that picture on a communist's t-shirt.\u201d\n!

The survey led to the Pulitzer Prize, the highest honor in journalism in the United States.\nThe registration earned photographer Andrew Lopez, from United Press International (UPI), the award in the Photography category in 1960. Lopez was part of a group of photojournalists who received authorization from Fidel Castro to freely record whatever they wanted. He decided to photograph the trials and executions of former combatants from Fulgencio Batista's defeated army.\nThe man in the photo is Jose Cipriano Rodriguez, according to the UPI news agency's website. The caption of the photo states that he was executed on January 17, 1959 for killing two men from Castro's army. His trial lasted one minute.\n!

None of the sites where Verifica found the photograph indicate whether Che Guevara was involved in the execution of Rodriguez.\nThe Cuban Revolution began as a nationalist guerrilla in 1959. Led by Fidel Castro, it overthrew the dictatorial government of Fulgencio Batista, which began in 1952 through a military coup.\nCuba is an island in the Caribbean very close to the territory of the United States. For this reason, the Americans followed the island's political changes with tension. The United States broke relations with Cuba and tried to overthrow its government in 1961, without success. The rivalry with the United States ended up making Cuba an ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War period.\nThis content was also checked by the agencies Lupa, from Brazil, Polygraph, from Portugal, Maldita.Es, from Spain, and Bolivia Verifica, from Bolivia.\nThis rumor was verified because it appears among the main suspicious content that circulates on Facebook. Estad\u00e3o Verifica has access to a list of potentially false posts and to data about their viralization as a result of a partnership with the social network. When our checks find that information is misleading, Facebook reduces the scope of its circulation. Social network users and page administrators receive notifications if they have published or shared posts marked as false. A notice is also sent to anyone who wants to post content that has been previously flagged as untrue.\nA prerequisite for participating in the partnership with Facebook is to obtain certification from the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN), which, in the case of Estad\u00e3o Verifica, occurred in January 2019. The international association of fact checkers requires certified entities to sign a code of principles and to make commitments in five areas: non-partisanship and impartiality; transparency of sources; transparency of funding and organization; transparency of methodology; and open and honest corrections policy. Commitment to these practices promotes more balance and precision at work.",

According to the accompanying text, the image would also have been awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1960. However, although it is true that he won that award, it is a hoax that he was a peasant or that he was shot for that reason: both the author of the image and the priest who appears in it, as well as the United Press International (UPI) and Getty Images agencies, the organizers of the Pulitzer Prizes and the Bohemia Magazine assure that the man shot, named Jose Cipriano Rodr\u00edguez, had been a corporal in the Army of which Fulgencio Batista was president of Cuba and not a \u201cCuban peasant\u201d who refused \u201cto work for the Castro regime\u201d.\nAccording to the Pulitzer Prize organization, Rodr\u00edguez was executed for \u201cwar crimes\u201d, while Getty Images and the Cuban magazine Bohemia indicate that he was killed after being accused of murdering two brothers.\n! [] (https://maldita.es/app/uploads/2020/09/Cuba3.jpg)\nThe photo, taken by photographer Andrew L\u00f3pez, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1960, as can be seen on the official website of the award. There they explain that the man who appears kneeling in the image was actually a corporal in the Batista Army \u201cexecuted by a firing squad\u201d of Fidel Castro. This was also indicated by the organizers of the Pulitzer Prizes in a 2016 Facebook post.\nThe man was a soldier in the Batista Army who was \u201csentenced to death for war crimes\u201d, according to the Pulitzer Prizes\nIn that Facebook post, another image is included in which the convict already appears in front of the wall, whose caption states that he had been \u201csentenced to death for war crimes\u201d and that the trial had lasted \u201cexactly one minute\u201d.\n! [] (https://maldita.es/app/uploads/2020/09/Che1-1024x383.jpg)\nThe image also appears in the archive of the Getty Images agency, where it is located in the Cuban city of Matanzas on January 17, 1959. In the description, they point out that the corporal was called Jos\u00e9 Cipriano Rodr\u00edguez and that he had been convicted \u201cfor the deaths of two brothers\u201d, while the priest is identified as Domingo Lorenzo.\nThe author of the photo and the priest who appears in it say that the shot was a corporal\nAfter searching for information about the religious, we found that he gave his version of what happened in a column published on ABC on November 22, 1962, which is available in his archive. There, Lorenzo explains that the man was called Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez (although he also names him \u201cPepe Caliente\u201d) and that he had been \u201ca corporal in the Army of General F. Batista Zaldivar\u201d.\nThe priest admits that he never knew \u201cwhat they accused him of, because in the midst of that shouting you couldn't hear the charges against him\u201d, but that in any case he was sentenced to \u201cdeath by shooting\u201d by Castro commander William G\u00e1lvez, who ordered that the execution be carried out at that very moment, although he ended up delaying it the next day since there were \u201cmany women\u201d present.\nAccording to Domingo Lorenzo, the commander demanded that the photographers \u201chand over all the reels of their cameras with the negatives\u201d and that \u201call but one American delivered them\u201d, referring to Andrew L\u00f3pez. You can read the priest's full testimony here.\nIn an excerpt from the book Picture This! The Inside Story and Classic Photos of UPI Newspictures, L\u00f3pez clarifies that he did deliver a reel but that he kept the one containing the photos of Pepe (referring to 'Pepe Caliente'). In any case, the photographer also identifies the prisoner as a corporal and assures that, although the trial itself lasted two hours, it took only a minute for the three judges of the court to sentence him to death. The full extract is available on the website of The Downhold Project, an initiative dedicated to disseminating historical information about the United Press International (UPI) agency, for which Andrew L\u00f3pez worked.\nThe press at the time also described 'Pepe Caliente' as a member of Batista's Army\nAs can be seen in this article in which they review the life of L\u00f3pez and other award-winning photographers, UPI itself also points out that 'Pepe Caliente' had been part of Batista's Army. This is also indicated by the Cuban magazine Bohemia, which in its edition of February 1, 1959, included an article on the trial and execution of Corporal Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez. In the text, they specify that Rodr\u00edguez had been part of the squad of the Cuban municipality of Jovellanos and that \u201che was found convicted of numerous crimes.\u201d In addition, Bohemia points out that the man shot confessed to the murder of two brothers, something that Maldita.ES has not been able to verify independently.\n!

The person who appears kneeling in the image, which dates back to 1959, is a soldier, according to the Pulitzer Prize website.\nThe award is mentioned in the post with the false claim. In fact, the image earned the photographer Andrew Lopez of the UPI news agency a Pulitzer in 1960. However, the caption of the photo on the award website clarifies that the man blessed by the priest was a member of the troops of Fulgencio Batista, the ruler deposed by the Cuban Revolution of 1959.\nThe soldier was executed by revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro. But in the information available on the Pulitzer website, there is no mention of Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara.\nThe same photo of Lopez can also be found in the archives of the Getty Images image agency, containing some additional information: the man on his knees was Corporal Jos\u00e9 Cipriano Rodr\u00edguez, who allegedly killed two people. The priest was called Domingo Lorenzo. Nor is there, however, any mention of Che Guevara.\nA check of the same image carried out by the Spanish site Maldita in early September also cites an article published in November 1962 by the ABC newspaper, also from Spain, which includes an interview with Father Domingo Lorenzo.

        "text": "Questionable Questionable Questionable Questionable Questionable Questionable Questionable\nQuestionable\nFor at least a year, a couple of photographs (1 and 2) have been circulating on social networks showing a Catholic priest giving him the blessing and talking to a man who is in the middle of a group of soldiers. The images are described by many users as the moment before the shooting of a \u201cCuban peasant by order of Che Guevara\u201d for refusing to work for the Castro regime.\nThe scenes circulate separately, but in almost all versions the explanation added by the users matches:\n\u201cThis photo won the Pulitzer Prize in 1960. A priest giving the last blessing to a Cuban peasant, owner of his land, who refused to work for Fidel Castro. He was shot without the right to defense, by order of Che Guevara, in a 'trial' that only lasted 4 minutes. Of course, you'll never see this photo on a t-shirt.\u201d\nThe last sentence refers to the iconic photograph taken in 1960 by the Cuban Alberto Korda and which today is part of popular culture.\nHowever, at Colombiacheck, we describe these types of publications as misleading, since the man who appears in the images was not a peasant, but Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, a former soldier in the army of the dictator Fulgencio Batista, who was overthrown on January 1, 1959. In addition, he was not convicted for not wanting to work for Castro, but, allegedly, for murder.\nPublications that link the images to the shooting of a peasant have circulated especially in Latin America and Spain. And according to CrowdTangle, a social media monitoring tool, these types of posts have had more than 39,000 interactions in the last year.\nIn Colombia, they have been disseminated by Facebook pages and groups such as Gustavo Petro: Communist Enemy of Democracy and the Constitution, Realidad Colombia Libre and Herbin Hoyos-Oficial. Some have been shared more than 1,000 times.\nThe images out of context were also published by Andr\u00e9s Felipe Arcos, a Uribista Twitter user with more than 22,900 followers who was a contractor for the Ministry of the Interior.\nWe did a reverse search of the images with the Google tool and found that they are indeed part of a series of photos awarded the Pulitzer Prize in photography in 1960. The author is Andrew L\u00f3pez, a Spaniard who at the time was part of the team of the news agency United Press International. In fact, the two photos that went viral are the only ones available on the Pulitzer Prizes page.\nBut in the description of the award-winning images, there is no reference to the shooting of a peasant. Instead, it is written that L\u00f3pez was awarded \u201cfor his series of four photographs of a corporal, a former member of the army of the dictator Batista, who was executed by a Castro firing squad, the main image showing the convict receiving the last rites\u201d.\nIn 2016, United Press International published an article about the stories behind the photos with which its reporters had so far won the Pulitzer Prize. In the description of L\u00f3pez's, it was specified that it portrays the moment when priest Domingo Lorenzo performed a rite before the shooting of Jos\u00e9 Cipriano Rodr\u00edguez, on January 17, 1959 (a few days after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution).\nAccording to the article, Rodr\u00edguez \u201chad served in Fulgencio Batista's army [and] was executed by firing squad after being convicted of the death of two brothers.\u201d\nUnited Press noted that the former military trial lasted \u201conly a minute.\u201d But our colleagues at Check Your Fact, in the United States, found that L\u00f3pez explained in an interview published in May 1960 by the American newspaper St. Louis Post-Dispatch that: \u201cRodr\u00edguez was sentenced after two hours of trial in the San Severino fortress near Matanzas, Cuba. The court met for one minute before finding him guilty.\u201d\nColombiacheck also found a record of the shooting of Rodr\u00edguez in Archivo Cuba, a project dedicated to collecting information on deaths and disappearances attributed to the Cuban Revolution, in which more than 11,000 documented cases appear.\nIn the case, one of the photos of Andrew L\u00f3pez appears and explains that he was a member of the Armed Forces during the Batista regime and was \u201cexecuted for allegedly having committed acts of torture and murder.\u201d\nWith this information, we describe as questionable the publications that relate two photos taken by the Spaniard Andrew L\u00f3pez to the shooting of a Cuban peasant for refusing to work for the Castro regime.\nIt is true that she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and corresponds to a religious ritual before a shooting, as explained in the publications, but the person was allegedly convicted of  assassinated and was a former soldier in Batista's army.",

The publications that accompany the video claim that it is supposedly about the Argentinian actress and singer Lali Esp\u00f3sito and would show a- \u201cviolent reaction in La Pampa by (Javier) Milei\u201d.

        "text": "A photograph purportedly showing a polar bear taking public transportation in Russia is frequently shared online with humorous captions such as \"just a normal day in Russia\":\nThis image has also been shared with punny captions such as \"The Polar Express,\" \"The bus was unBEARable,\" \"Auditioning for the new Coca-Cola bear,\" and \"Kindly bear with us as we get this aggressive passenger of the bus.\"\nThis picture is a genuine photograph in the sense that it was not digitally manipulated, but it does not, as often claimed, capture a real polar bear exiting a bus in Russia.\nWhat this picture actually shows is a puppet known as \"Paula the Polar Bear\" exiting a tram in the Czech Republic city of Brno during a \"Save the Arctic\" campaign by Greenpeace. (The name of Rakoveck\u00e1, a street in Brno, can be seen on the bus sign.) Two activists are actually operating this puppet from the inside as other Greenpeace members inform the public about matters such as climate change and arctic drilling.\nThe Greenpeace Czech Republic Facebook page shared an image of Paula the Polar Bear in Liberec in October 2014:\nThe Brno news outlet Centrum News reported in 2015 that this realistic polar bear puppet had frightened a few passers-by as it walked through the supermarket in \u017didenice (translated via Google):\nOn Friday afternoon a city police patrol quickly responded to a supermarket in \u017didenice, where a polar bear, according to a caller, was walking around.\nThe policemen in Buben\u00ed\u010dkova Street actually saw a furry white animal, but it was only a costume used by ecological activists.\nThe bear costume was very realistic, so some of the passers-by were fooled. Two people were hidden inside the life-sized costume.\nPaula the Polar Bear has made appearances in cities all over the world. Here, for example, is a video of Paula the Polar Bear visiting the Canterbury Cathedral in England:\nThe Paula the Polar Bear puppet was also used in a short film starring Jude Law to promote Greenpeace's \"Save the Arctic\" campaign:\n\u201cI came up with the concept after having been asked by Greenpeace to judge a short VW film competition they were running and being taken on a guided tour of the building, when I was duly shown around their warehouse and spotted a life-sized suit of a polar bear called Paula hanging from a pole -- a relic from a play called \u2018Greenland\u2019 at the National Theatre in London,\u201d says Michael.\n\u201cAfter a brief conversation with Head of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, about their up-and-coming Save the Arctic campaign, I took some pictures of the bear and started thinking about how I could tell her story, and a simple idea came to me: what if, because we had made her homeless, this polar bear had traveled so far in search of food that she would be living on the streets of London.\n\u201cI thought that the obvious parallels with the homeless in any major city might make her issues more obvious to us city dwellers, especially as we live thousands of miles away.\u201d\nThe stunning polar bear costume was operated by puppeteers from London\u2019s Broadway and West End production \u2018War Horse\u2019 who rehearsed the bear\u2019s articulations. A team of post-effects artists from London\u2019s Moving Picture Company worked on face manipulation.\nA short film documenting the making of \"The Homeless Polar Bear\" provides a better look at how Paula the Polar Bear is operated:",

        "text": "Brad Pitt is having a serious moment right now \u2014 oh wait, it's called his entire life. No, but seriously, after years out of the spotlight, the megastar is making some kind of comeback. First, he books a mysterious and sexy Chanel ad. And, now, he's Interview magazine's main man.\nWell, we have no complaints. But we do have one question: Is this the same Brad we know and love in these five crazy photos? A dreadlocked, bleached-beard, ripped-sweater-wearing Rasta type wasn't the only character Pitt donned for the shoot; in fact, he posted in a variety of completely different outfits, from a casual pirate to a Scarface-style gangster complete with gold chain and pistol. He's nothing if not versatile. Oh, and by the way, the interview is pretty interesting, too. (Interview via Styleite)\nHit the slideshow and tell us: Are you ready for Brad's comeback? Or, in your book, has he never left?",

Of course you do\n- Words\n- James Cartwright\n- \u2014\n- Date\n- 15 October 2012\nIf you\u2019re female, male, old, young, or anything else in between you\u2019ll undoubtedly be acquainted with Brad Pitt and his perfectly chiseled features. Without wishing to go all Brian Sewell on you, he\u2019s a handsome devil. To prove this long-accepted fact he\u2019s been photographed in a most striking and unusual fashion for the latest Interview magazine to accompany his feature by Guy Ritchie. Shot by the notorious Steven Klein in a number of extraordinary guises (bizarrely including a dreadlocked hippie) these are the most striking photos of Pitt that we\u2019ve ever laid eyes on, and prove beyond doubt that however you dress him up, he\u2019s a damn fine specimen of a man.\nSteven Klein: Brad Pitt\nSteven Klein: Brad Pitt\nSteven Klein: Brad Pitt\nSteven Klein: Brad Pitt\nSteven Klein: Brad Pitt\nSteven Klein: Brad Pitt\nSteven Klein: Brad Pitt\nSteven Klein: Brad Pitt\nSteven Klein: Brad Pitt\nShare Article\nFurther Info\nAbout the Author\n\u2014\nJames started out as an intern in 2011 and came back in summer of 2012 to work online and latterly as Print Editor, before leaving in May 2015.",

        "text": "'The family is first': Brad Pitt opens up about his children as he transforms into dreadlocked Rasta man for Interview magazine\nHe earned his stripes in Hollywood as a cowboy hitchhiker and has been nominated for an Oscar as a man who ages in reverse.\nNow, Brad Pitt has transformed into a dreaded Rasta man for Interview magazine.\nThe 48-year-old star, photographed by Steven Klein, whips his head back in one image, accompanying his interview with Snatch director Guy Ritchie.\n![Dreaded: Brad Pitt sports the new look in a photograph shot by Steven Klein](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/09/article-2215227-156D72F0000005DC-388_634x733.jpg)\nDreaded: Brad Pitt sports the new look in a photograph shot by Steven Klein\nWearing a ripped sweater, and with a full goate, the actor shuts his eyes and appears to be adrift in his own world.\nOther photographs shot by Klein show Hollywood's golden boy as a rake, a drifter and a hitman.\nSpeaking to Ritchie, the Fight Club star reveals he's becoming more selective with his film roles to focus fatherhood.\n'I want it to be worthy enough of a story to leave the family, you know? They\u2019re everything,' he says of his six children with Angelina Jolie. 'The family is first.'\n![Chameleon: The 48-year-old actor slipped into several different characters for the shootine](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/09/article-2215227-156D72EC000005DC-881_634x815.jpg)\nChameleon: The 48-year-old actor slipped into several different characters for the shoot\nThe actor said he feels accomplished enough in his career to be more discerning, admitting he feels now he can 'jump into anything and lay something down that's quality.'\n![Covered: The star features in Interview magazine's October/November 2012 issue](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/09/article-2215227-156D72E8000005DC-948_306x397.jpg)\nCovered: The star features in Interview magazine's October/November 2012 issue\nThe actor shares Maddox, 11, Pax, eight, Zahara, seven, Shiloh, six, and four-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne with Jolie, says it's also important he doesn't 'embarrass' his brood.\nBut he's worked long enough to know exactly the type of person he might allow to pull him away from his role as a dad and future husband.\n'...As I get older, it's about the company that I keep,' Pitt says.\n'That's the most important thing to me - that if I'm gonna spend however long it takes to make a movie, give up 14 hours a day for however many weeks or months, then it's very important for me to know that I'm working with people who I respect and enjoy and that we're going for something together.\n'That's it, really.'\nBrad is next set to star Andrew Dominik film Killing Them Softly.\nBut the crime thriller, he says, is really meant to take a more serious look at American politics.\n'We're at a particularly ugly time when we're at such a divide in America, but that divide is not there because everyone is trying to figure out what\u2019s best for the people,' he explains.\n'It\u2019s there because one side is trying to win out over the other side.'\nKilling Them Softly is set for a crime thriller is set for a November 30 release.\nMost watched News videos\n- Travel chaos as flights traveling to Heathrow diverted\n- Dramatic moment pilot turns flight back heading to Heathrow Airport\n- Global travel chaos as Heathrow shuts down\n- Heathrow power outage after electricity substation fire\n- Moment drunk barmaid sobs 'who's dead?' after killing friend\n- Joe Rogan breaks with Trump after calling out 'ridiculous' stance\n- Dramatic moment Marcin Majerkiewicz arrested whilst on bus by cops\n- US travelers bash Heathrow as canceled flight leaves some stranded\n- Indiana mom boards bus and brutally beats son's 14-year-old bully\n- Dramatic aerials from near Heathrow following fire at substation\n- Man fears brother is his son after sexually assaulted by mom in teens\n- Huge blaze as fire hits electricity substation near Heathrow\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.",

        "description": "Demonstrations held against Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s extremist stance ahead of election",
        "text": "The homecoming of Brazil\u2019s far-right presidential frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro from hospital was upstaged this weekend by huge demonstrations as concerns over his authoritarian tendencies grew.\nBolsonaro flew from S\u00e3o Paulo to his home in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday, three weeks after being stabbed during campaigning, while tens of thousands of women filled the streets in cities across Brazil to protest against his extremist positions ahead of the 7 October election.\nThe G1 news site reported anti-Bolsonaro protests in all Brazil\u2019s 27 states grew out of a Facebook group called Women United Against Bolsonaro which nearly 4 million people have joined. Pro-Bolsonaro demonstrations took place in 16 states, the site said. The piau\u00ed magazine website called the demonstrations \u201chistoric\u201d and printed a photo of an enormous crowd in S\u00e3o Paulo which organisers claimed half a million attended, though police did not provide an estimate.\nProfile\nWho is Jair Bolsonaro?Show\n![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cb6040e8830a6aa1aa29474c00ab5d64bf44d29/0_0_3406_3406/3406.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=47f05c9474dd1169d78464d3d73e370c)\nBiography\nBorn in Glic\u00e9rio in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1955 to parents of Italian descent, he served in the army from 1971 until 1988, when he was elected as a city councillor in Rio de Janeiro for the Christian Democratic party. In 1990, he became a federal congressman for the same party. He has since been affiliated with a number of political parties. On 22 July, he was officially nominated as the presidential candidate of the Social Liberal party.\nPolicies\nBolsonaro espouses populist and nationalist views that often stray into far-right territory. A vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, abortion, immigration and other progressive causes, he has defended the death penalty and the 1964-85 military dictatorship. On foreign policy, he has said he wants to improve relations with the US. Economically he says he is pro free market and privatisation.\nPolitical style\nDeliberately provocative and polarising. He has praised Gen Pinochet, expressed support for torturers and called for political opponents to be shot, earning him the label of \"the most misogynistic, hateful elected official in the democratic world\u201d. In his bid to capitalise on Latin America\u2019s lurch to the right, he paints himself as a tropical Donald Trump: a pro-gun, anti-establishment crusader set on \"draining the swamp\" and cracking down on violent crime.\nControversies\nOn top of repeated calls for a return to dictatorship, he has made equally inflammatory attacks on women, black people, gay people, foreigners and indigenous communities. Earlier this year, he was charged by the attorney general with inciting hate speech.\nSupport and first round victory\nBolsonaro has a devout following among some conservative voters, who admire his promises to get tough on rampant violent crime, and won 46% of the vote in the election's first round.\nIn Rio the huge crowds that filled the city centre were notable for their diversity \u2013 with women of all ages, many of whom had brought children, male and LGBT demonstrators, chanting \u201cnot him\u201d, an anti-Bolsonaro hashtag that has become a campaign slogan shared by celebrities like Madonna.\nMany demonstrators expressed concerns over Bolsonaro\u2019s declaration in a television interview on Friday that he would not accept any election result he did not win because of his endorsement of the military dictatorship which ran Brazil for two decades.\n![Jair Bolsonaro sits on a plane at the airport in S\u00e3o Paulo.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f24e0b2b2464f2e099afd8391685ea73e220721/0_336_2942_1765/master/2942.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\nFlavia Carvalho, 40, a civil servant, carried a \u201cnot him\u201d banner designed around an Adolf Hitler cartoon. \u201cHe is preaching fascism,\u201d she said. Others said they were protesting against the sexist, racist and homophobic views Bolsonaro has expressed.\n\u201cHe is sexist. He is misogynist. He is racist,\u201d said Ana Paulo Gon\u00e7alves, 24, a teacher. \u201cHe wants to go back to the military dictatorship,\u201d said her sister Christine, 29, a designer.\nBolsonaro, a former army captain and veteran lawmaker, currently leads polling for a first-round vote on 7 October. Running second is Fernando Haddad, a former mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo who took the place of formidably popular former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva after Lula\u2019s candidacy was barred because he is serving a prison sentence for graft. Bolsonaro and Haddad are expected to face off in a run-off vote on 28 October.\nMaking adept use of WhatsApp and social media, Bolsonaro has built support across Brazil, attacking Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party for its involvement in a huge graft scheme and espousing a hardline approach to law and order. His views have resonated with Brazilians angry and fearful over endemic corruption and rising violent crime. Supporters stage drive-by demonstrations, racing through towns across Brazil in convoys of cars and motorbikes, wavi ng flags and blasting horns.\n![People gather during a demonstration against Brazil\u2019s presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19132783a75d5487023dbc96b5677cb33300fa3f/0_264_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\nThe divisions Bolsonaro provokes in Brazil were evident in a video of him boarding Saturday\u2019s flight from S\u00e3o Paulo. While some passengers regaled him with chants of \u201clegend\u201d, others yelled \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cnot him\u201d.\nIn a television interview broadcast on Friday, Bolsonaro suggested Brazil\u2019s armed forces could intervene if his main rivals, the leftist Workers\u2019 party, \u201ccommitted a foul\u201d in the election.\n\u201cI don\u2019t accept an election that is not me being elected,\u201d Bolsonaro told reporter Jos\u00e9 Datena, adding that Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system could be defrauded by the Workers\u2019 party, but providing no evidence.\nBolsonaro enjoys widespread support among police and the military. His vice-presidential candidate, Gen Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, unnerved Brazilians recently when he said in a situation of \u201canarchy\u201d, a president could declare an \u201cauto-coup\u201d.

The protest was peaceful.\nMinas Gerais\nIn Minas Gerais, demonstrations take place at Pra\u00e7a da Sete, the central point of Belo Horizonte.

Flags and stickers of other candidates and politicians were seen at the demonstration. Voters of Fernando Haddad (PT), Ciro Gomes (PDT) and Marina Silva (Network) mixed with supporters of former presidents Lula and Dilma Rousseff.\nMundo\nSeveral cities around the world have also registered acts against Bolsonaro. With the slogan #EleN\u00e3o \u2014 created in a campaign by a Facebook group that brings together 3.8 million women \u2014 people organized and protested in cities in Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, and Portugal.\nSwitzerland\nIn Geneva, one of the main cities in Switzerland, people protested outside the headquarters of the United Nations (UN) in Europe. They carried signs with words contrary to the candidate and called for an end to \u201cfascism\u201d.\nFrance\nIn Paris, France, where the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen, of the National Front, has gained strength in recent years, at least 250 people organized in the city center to protest against the Brazilian candidate.\nImages posted on social media with the hashtag #Elen\u00e3o also show demonstrations in Milan, Italy. In Barcelona, in Spain, and in Lisbon, in Portugal, there were also protests.\n! [Zakaria ABDELKAFI/AFP Zakaria ABDELKAFI/AFP] (http://www.rbsdirect.com.br/imagesrc/24715285.jpg?w=700)\nIn an interview with the newspaper O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, the group's creator, Ludimilla Teixeira, stated that she \u201conly lit a match in the powder keg\u201d. On Friday (28), the singer Madonna posted a message against Bolsonaro and increased the visibility of the movement on social media.\nAccording to the movement's leaders, the #EleN\u00e3o campaign is to alert the population to Bolsonaro's ideas, considered by the participants to be \u201cfascists and sexists\u201d. The growth of the movement provoked reactions - on the weekend of the 15th and 16th, when it had around 2.5 million participants, the Facebook group even went offline after being hacked No and have the name changed with a favorable reference to the PSL candidate. Women were verbally assaulted and threatened.\nPhysical violence is also suspected in Rio. One of the group's administrators in the city filed a police report with the Civil Police stating that she was assaulted on Monday night (24) by two unidentified men. The activist stated that she had been threatened on the networks because of political militancy, but said she could not say who the aggressors were. The men took only the victim's cell phone, leaving the remaining belongings.\nThe mobilization through social networks began to attract attention in mid-September, bringing together more than 300,000 women in a single day. It is a reflection of the rejection of Bolsonaro among female voters - the percentage of women who, in the polls with the intention to vote, say that they would never vote for the Fluminense congressman is higher than that of men.",

Ga\u00fachazH points out below the 10 fundamental facts of the 2018 presidential race, the episodes and situations that marked the electoral period, shaped the performance of the candidates and should define, this Sunday, the result of the polls.\n1) The stabbing\n! [RAYSA LEITE/AFP RAYSA LEITE/AFP] (http://www.rbsdirect.com.br/imagesrc/24726171.jpg?w=700)\nCan a madman, armed with a kitchen knife, determine who will be the president of Brazil? Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) had 22% of the voting intentions when he was stabbed on September 6 during a campaign event in Juiz de Fora (MG). Three days later, it was 26%. Three more, and it was up to 28%. From then on, it would be backwards.\nThis effect was immediately predicted by analysts: the status of victim would shock part of the electorate. What was not foreseen was how much the stabbing would revolutionize the campaign. What at first appeared to be a superficial injury proved to be serious, leading to two surgeries and three weeks of hospitalization. Brazil began to live with a candidate who advertised from the hospital bed. It seemed like a disadvantage, but it wasn't. Bolsonaro dominated the news and was spared from wearing himself out in debates. Banned from hitting someone with their lives at risk, the opponents lowered their tone. Meanwhile, the Bolsonaristas were selling the false idea that the stabbing came from the PT.\nThe author, Adelio Bispo, 40, diagnosed with mental problems, announced when he was arrested that he had stabbed him at the behest of God. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, the candidate's son, presented the opposite version: \u201cGod acted and pulled the knife away\u201d.\n2) Lula candidate\n! [EVARISTO SA/AFP EVARISTO SA/AFP] (http://www.rbsdirect.com.br/imagesrc/24726170.jpg?w=700)\nHave you ever imagined a convict in prison running for office, being elected and governing Brazil from his cell? The PT members imagined - or at least pretended. In August, when he had been serving a sentence for four months, former president Lula was chosen by acclamation to be the PT's candidate. Fernando Haddad, former mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo by the party, would be the vice-president.\nTruth be told, the voter jumped on board. At the end of August, Lula beat 40% in the polls, twice that of Bolsonaro (PSL). The PT's decision, however, gave the campaign an air of magical realism. There was one candidate that everyone knew was not a candidate. There was an individual pretending to be the vice-president, but that everyone knew he would be the running mate.\nAnd there were electoral polls that, because of that, everyone knew that they didn't want to say anything. Faith in President Lula gained an unexpected boost when the UN Human Rights Committee affirmed and reaffirmed, in August and early September, that the Brazilian State should guarantee the candidacy. The Superior Electoral Court (TSE) declined to know. It barred the participation of the former president.\nFor the PT members, \u201celection without Lula is a fraud\u201d - but not after September 11, when they began to promote Haddad, the replacement anointed by the chief at the last minute.\n3) #EleN\u00e3o x #EleSim\n! [Miguel SCHINCARIOL/AFP Miguel SCHINCARIOL/AFP] (http://www.rbsdirect.com.br/imagesrc/24726188.jpg?w=700)\nOne of the consequences of the campaign was a women's movement of unprecedented dimensions. It was born on the internet, with the hashtag #EleN\u00e3o, and ended up in the streets during the biggest mass demonstrations of the electoral period. Multi and suprapartisan, the movement preached a simple idea: no matter their political preference, they should all unite against Bolsonaro, seen as a threat to women's rights. It could be anyone. But not him.\nThe hashtag began to spread at a time when the candidate stagnated in the polls and when Haddad was rising. On the 29th, it led to events that brought together crowds in dozens of cities in Brazil and also in metropolises around the world. There was an atmosphere of euphoria among Bolsonaro's rivals: women would save the country. The feeling was that, on Monday, the new Ibope survey would mark a turning point in the game.\nThe cold water bath ensued. Instead of falling, Bolsonaro rose four points. It grew mainly in the female electorate, which said: \u201cHe, yes\u201d. The perplexity was general. What will happen? What is the reason for the reverse effect? There's still no explanation. One hypothesis: women took to the streets to warn that Bolsonaro is different from all the others - precisely the reason for the vote of his supporters.\n4) End of polarization\nBrazil has hundreds of parties, but when the president was elected, an oiled mechanism was working: the dispute was between the PT and the PSDB. It had been like this almost since the dawn of the re-democratization: Fernando Henrique x Lula (1994 and 1998), Lula x Jos\u00e9 Serra (2002), Lula x Alckmin (2006), Dilma Rousseff x Jos\u00e9 Serra (2010), Dilma x A\u00e9cio Neves (2014).\nIn 2018, after 24 years, things went wrong. Brazil remained divided between PT and anti-PT members, but the antipetism changed its face: it disbanded the PSDB. Or Candid The Tucano actor, Geraldo Alckmin, spent the entire campaign below 10% of the voting intentions, in fourth position.\nWhy, if only four years earlier A\u00e9cio was the hope of political ethics for half of the electorate, who saw the PT as a den of corruption? Well, the answer also lies in A\u00e9cio himself. While still president of the PSDB, he was caught getting a bribe of R$ 2 million.\nThe involvement of the toucanate in robberies created, among the antipetists, the idea that everyone is the same, everyone is corrupt. The problem was no longer just the PT, it was the parties, the political system. And the only way out would be someone who seemed to come from outside, who despised the parties, the system and, perhaps, democracy itself.\n5) Fake news\nLies have always existed, it's true, but fake news is a different phenomenon. On the internet, lies disguised as news gush out to manipulate opinions. It's the principle of the wolf in sheep's clothing: the credibility of journalism is usurped for nefarious purposes.\nIt had already been announced that, as in the American election that brought Donald Trump to the presidency, the campaign in Brazil would be plagued by this evil. Sadly, it was confirmed. In recent days, network monitoring revealed that the phenomenon had exploded, with reckless manipulations taking place via Facebook and WhatsApp. According to digital media observatories, the most active in this field were Bolsonaro's supporters.\nThis is a tragic phenomenon, which leads millions of voters detached from reality to the polls to justify their vote based on absurd lies. It's fiction and falsehood deciding the country's future.\nIn the midst of darkness, traditional media outlets launched initiatives to verify and denounce fake news, called fact checking. How did the handlers react? They once again put on the skin of the lamb. They created fake fact checking.\n6) Last minute\n! [Rodolfo Buhrer/Folhapress Rodolfo Buhrer/Folhapress] (http://www.rbsdirect.com.br/imagesrc/24726172.jpg?w=700)\nAfter stretching the fiction of his candidacy to the last minute, on September 11, Lula risked the miracle of transubstantiating candidates. He anointed Haddad to his place and proclaimed the dogma: Lula is Haddad, Haddad is Lula. The maneuver, which consisted of accumulating voting intentions and then transferring them to others, was risky. Presented as a candidate in place of chief, Haddad appeared in fifth or sixth place in the polls, in the 4% range. With less than a month left until the election, he was unknown. In the Northeast, Lulism's largest pocket, he was referred to as Adraike, Adauto, Andrade, Alade, Radarde.\nStill, transubstantiation worked, at least in the beginning. Once an official candidate, Haddad was overcome with a flurry of votes. In 10 days, it rose to 22%, just six points behind Bolsonaro. In the second round, he beat his opponent: 45% x 39%. The anonymous person who appeared almost out of nowhere appeared as the virtual future president of Brazil.\nThat impression was shaken at the end of the campaign. After the shooting, the former mayor stalled and, upon becoming better known, inherited the rejection of antipetism. He even failed to win in the second round, according to projections. He comes to voting day with the challenge of showing that there is light on that pole.\n7) From the street to the hammocks\nBrazilians who had the opportunity to visit another country on election day returned amazed: judging by what they saw on foreign streets, there was no reason to suspect that a vote was in progress. In 2018, Brazil became that type of country. In contrast to the recent past, you barely see flags on windows, electoral cords on corners, and stickers on cars.\nIt's not that we're contained. It's just that the mobilization migrated from the streets to the networks. It was in the virtual squares of Facebook and WhatsApp that the melee, the flag and the urn took place. Under the appearance of placidity, the whirlwind boiled.\nMemes, rumors, and videos on the internet made even what was the main channel for balancing the voter superfluous: election time. In four of the seven elections, whoever had the most time won and, since 1998, the two best-valued candidates have always been in the second round.\nThat season is over. It was believed that the time champion, Alckmin, at 5:32 seconds, would take off, but he didn't leave his seat. Bolsonaro emerged, with only 8 seconds - 40 times less.\n8) Center failure\nOn January 1, 2019, a man hated by a large part of the population is due to take office as president. Whether Bolsonaro or Haddad, it won't just be a creature that nearly half of the people didn't vote for, but who would never vote for.\nThe next ruler will be detested, to some extent, because the center failed to offer a strong, viable, and exciting alternative. Of course, the \u201ccenter\u201d classification is highly debatable. Ciro Gomes (PDT) is on the left, Alckmin is on the right and Marina Silva (Rede) \u2014 who has already said she is not from the right, the left, or the center, but to be in the lead \u2014 was left behind as always.\nWhat is certain is that the three of them tried to put themselves as a moderate option laring. At first, Ciro seemed well positioned for the role, but he failed to negotiate with the self-styled centr\u00e3o (DEM, PP, PR, PRB, and SD), who chose Alckmin. The toucan, despite the megacoallion, confirmed the fame of the chuchu popsicle. And Marina repeated the dose: she was the candidate who, the more she campaigns, the less votes she has. In the final stretch, when there was no time left, there was still a mobilization to unite the three around the name of Ciro, on an \u201cAlcirina\u201d plate. New failure.\n9) Poverty Campaign\nThis is the first election for president after the end of corporate funding - and it shows. Candidates were unable to even reach the established ceiling of R$ 70 million. The most expensive campaign, from the PT, was projected at R$ 50 million. Alckmin estimated his at R$ 43 million. Four years ago, Dilma spent R$ 445 million and A\u00e9cio, R$ 289 million, in inflation-adjusted amounts.\nThe campaigns won out in a big way. Mega-productions and marketers are gone by the weight of gold. The new situation of poverty was also conducive to the emergence of the figure of the multimillionaire candidate, with a safe haven to put money out of his own pocket.\nJo\u00e3o Am\u00f4edo (Novo), a declared asset of R$ 425 million, reported that banking with personal resources up to 20% of the expenses, calculated at R$ 7 million \u2014 by Friday, however, he had invested a modest R$ 100 thousand. Henrique Meirelles (MDB), owner of R$ 377 million, was more wasteful: he put R$ 45 million into his own campaign. Taking into account the latest polls, which gave him 2% of the electorate, he was spending R$ 17 per vote.\n10) Dispute without situation\n! [DANIEL TEIXEIRA/ESTAD\u00c3O CONTENT DANIEL TEIXEIRA/ESTAD\u00c3O CONTENT] (http://www.rbsdirect.com.br/imagesrc/24726173.jpg?w=700)\nSince the re-democratization, the campaigns for the Presidency had at the center of the debate the term that was coming to an end. There was a candidate in the situation and those who were trying to accredit themselves by attacking the government. Being in the situation, in general, was the best deal. In seven elections, five were won by the official candidate.\nIn 2018, the writing changed. No candidate risked posing as Michel Temer's heir, for obvious reasons: he is the most unpopular president in history. And take a good look at it, almost everyone is involved in the current administration. Bolsonaro's PSL was the most loyal to the government in Congress, voting in favor of Planalto's interests more frequently than even the MDB, the president's party. Alckmin, in turn, has eight parties in the coalition out of a total of nine that participate or have participated in the current administration, taking over ministries. Marina and Alvaro Dias (Podemos) were also linked to captions that accepted positions from the ruler nicknamed \u201cvampire\u201d.\nThe most surprising case is that of Meirelles. In addition to being part of the MDB, the current party, he was finance minister and only left office six months ago. Even so, not only did he deny being a Temer candidate during the campaign, but he also tried to link his name to that of Lula.",

About an hour later, the group began to disperse and a small part went to the door of Rede Globo to make a \u201chonk\u201d.\nThe pro-Bolsonaro movement was organized into groups on social media. The page of one of these groups states that candidate support events have been held routinely on Sundays and will continue until the second round, if any.\nThis Saturday, the 29th, anti-Bolsonaro demonstrators filled the streets of the capitals, the Federal District, and several cities in the interior of Brazil. Cities from other countries also gathered protests against the candidate, including Lisbon, Paris, and Washington. Under the slogan #EleN\u00e3o, the campaign was created within a Facebook group that brings together 3.8 million women. The movement's leaders say that the campaign is to alert the population about Bolsonaro's ideas, considered by the participants to be \u201cfascists and sexists\u201d.\n!

The event includes the participation of district candidates allied to the presidential candidate of the PSL.\nVoting intentions\nReserve captain and seven-term federal congressman, Bolsonaro had been leading the recent polls of intent to vote for the first round. On Sunday, for the first time, the candidate appears to be technically tied with the presidential candidate of the PT, Fernando Haddad, according to the results of the MDA Institute survey commissioned by the National Transportation Confederation (CNT).\nThe survey released this Sunday (30) shows Bolsonaro with 28.2% of the voting intentions and Haddad with 25.2% of the interviewees' preference. The margin of error is 2.2 percentage points higher or lower. Considering this margin, Bolsonaro may have between 26% and 30.4%. Haddad, on the other hand, may have between 23% and 27.4%.\nOn Saturday, Bolsonaro was discharged from the Albert Einstein Hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo after 22 days of hospitalization. He was the target of a knife attack during a campaign event in Juiz de Fora (MG) on September 6.",

        "text": "Brazil will experience the first round of a polarized presidential election on Sunday as never before with, for the first time, a far-right candidate in the position of favorite: ex-army captain Jair Bolsonaro, an apologist for dictatorship.\nFor weeks, all the polls have predicted the qualification in a seat for the 2nd round on October 28 of the 63-year-old deputy, under the colors of the small Liberal Social Party (PSL). Credited until now with some 32% of voting intentions, Jair Bolsonaro rose by three points in a poll published on Thursday (35%).\nIf the polls are more reliable than in the last elections, the left-wing candidate Fernando Haddad, 55, of the Workers' Party (PT) should come in 2nd position (at 22% in the last poll on Thursday), just four weeks after replacing ex-president Lula, who was ineligible because he was imprisoned for corruption.\n!

He wants to cleanse the country of its \u201ccorrupt elites\u201d, appoint six general ministers and boost the economy with an ultra-liberal program. He is against abortion and equal pay for men and women.\nSpared by corruption scandals, he draws his strength, increased tenfold by social networks, from his anti-system posture -- even though he has been a deputy for 27 years -- and from a virulent anti-PT feeling.\n\u201cThis pro-Bolsonaro vote that you will find in every social class is a vote to reject institutional politics,\u201d said Joao Feres, a political scientist at the Institute of Political and Social Studies in Rio.\nRegardless of the fact that he admits to being an economic jerk, the markets have ended up choosing sides. In recent days, both the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange and the Real have picked up steam with very good polls.\nHaddad, on the other hand, wants to \u201cmake the people happy again\u201d as under Lula's two growth mandates (2003-2010), through social policies, the end of the freeze on public spending and gun control.\n- 'Voting out of fear or anger' -\n!

Fear or anger rather than conviction\u201d, predicts Mr. Monteiro, who expects \u201can even more radical second round, perhaps with violence\u201d.\n!

The PSDB candidate Geraldo Alckmin (8%) will have embodied the unexpected collapse of the center. As for the environmentalist Marina Silva (Rede), who had won more than 20 million votes in the last two presidential elections, she collapsed by 4%.",

Her schedule was too tight for a trip to Bismarck, so I offered to take my portable darkroom and chemicals and gear to Standing Rock, [saying] \u2018if I can get 15 minutes, we could immortalize Greta in the historic photographic process of silver on glass\u2019 \u2014 this picture would outlast all other photographs ever taken of her or will ever be taken of her.\n\u201cI got the word Monday afternoon that I could have 15 minutes of her time if I traveled to the reservation and take her portrait, so that is what I did.\u201d\nWhen Balkowitsch arrived at the agreed-upon location, he set up for the shoot in the open and waited for Thunberg to arrive.\n\u201cI knew [Thunberg and her father] were pressed on time,\u201d Balkowitsch says, \u201cso after they saw the first plate come to life in the fixer I looked at them and said, \u2018can we do one more\u2019, and her father said \u2018Certainly,\u2019 [and] that is when I made \u2018Standing For Us All,\u2019 a now iconic image of her standing at Standing Rock in the field.\u201d\nHere are the two portraits that resulted from the 20-minute shoot:\n![](https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/10/Greta-Tintin-Eleanora-Ernman-Thunberg-10-8-2019-3328-Low-Resolution-636x800.jpg)\nYou can find more of Balkowitsch\u2019s work on his website, Facebook, and Instagram.\nP.S. Here\u2019s an interview Balkowitsch gave Michael Comeau of On Portraits. Interesting fact: Balkowitsch never owned a camera before he jumped into the world of wet plate photography.\nImage credits: Wet plate photos by Shane Balkowitsch.

        "text": "Behind TIME\u2019s Cover Photo of Greta Thunberg, 2019 Person of the Year\nTIME today announced that teen climate activist Greta Thunberg is its 2019 Person of the Year. The 16-year-old becomes the youngest individual ever to receive TIME\u2019s annual honor.\n\u201cWhen TIME asked me to photograph Greta, I was thinking how can I make a portrait that combines gentleness and at the same time courage,\u201d Arbugaeva tells TIME. \u201cHow do I capture the intense, focused gaze inwards as well as outwards, which I feel is characteristic of Greta. It was not an easy task.\u201d\nThe photographer started off by creating a mood board with references from Botticelli, Monet, Norse mythology, tarot cards, and Romantic period art. She then scouted Lisbon for a couple of days before settling on a rocky beach found near the Portuguese city.\nArbugaeva held the photo shoot on December 4th.\n![](https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/12/unnamed1-800x600.jpg)\n![](https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/12/TIME-POY-BTS2-600x800.jpg)\n\u201cAs she stood for a photograph, the sky colored golden pink creating beautiful light, ocean tide was rising and waves were raging around her,\u201d Arbugaeva tells TIME. \u201cGreta stood tall and strong without moving, just a few strands of her hair fluttering in a gentle breeze. She looked straight ahead into the ocean she just crossed.\n\u201cAt this moment it felt as if all nature elements and forces aligned to create the magic\u2014the most treasured gift for a photographer.\u201d\n\u201cMeaningful change rarely happens without the galvanizing force of influential individuals, and in 2019, the earth\u2019s existential crisis found one in Greta Thunberg,\u201d says TIME Editor-in-Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal regarding Thunberg\u2019s selection. \u201cThunberg has become the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet\u2014and the avatar of a broader generational shift in our culture that is playing out everywhere from the campuses of Hong Kong to the halls of Congress in Washington.\n\u201cThis was the year the climate crisis went from behind the curtain to center stage, from ambient political noise to squarely on the world\u2019s agenda, and no one did more to make that happen than Thunberg.\n\u201cFor sounding the alarm about humanity\u2019s predatory relationship with the only home we have, for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders, for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads, Greta Thunberg is TIME\u2019s 2019 Person of the Year.\u201d",

        "text": "Climate change activist Greta Thunberg is just 16 years old, but has already captured the attention of the world\u2014and a nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize. With her aim to spotlight environmental crisis, it's no surprise that she decided to pay a visit to Standing Rock, where indigenous groups are fighting the Dakota Access oil pipeline. It was here that she also met with Shane Balkowitsch, a wet plate photographer who has been taking powerful portraits of Northern Plains Native Americans. The sacred grounds at Standing Rock provided the perfect backdrop for Balkowitsch to immortalize the teen activist.\nIt was a brief encounter, with Balkowitsch given just 20 minutes at the conclusion of a special ceremony to take the portraits. Thunberg had just been honored with the Lakota Native American name Maphiyata echiyatan his win which translates as \u201cwoman who came from the heavens\u201d\u2014given to her by tribal leaders to acknowledge her important work. For the photographer, who has four children of his own and is quite concerned about the state of the planet, the moment was unforgettable.\n\u201cUp to the moment that we met I really could not get my arms around how this child was able to grab the attention of the world in such a short amount of time,\u201d Balkowitsch tells My Modern Met. \u201cAfter meeting her and spending a little personal time with her, I now understand. There is a presence and a maturity about her that is very hard to explain. She is very soft-spoken but she seems to be present in every single moment. There is an intent in her being that is not seen every day.\u201d\nBalkowitsch had been told that there would only be time for one portrait, but after seeing the beautiful first exposure, everyone immediately agreed to a second photograph. After positioning her in an open field, he took what is now called Standing For Us All. It's an evocative portrait that captures the strength of Thunberg's character and the wisdom beyond her years that she displays as she tirelessly works to invoke change.\nWet plate photographer Shane Balkowitsch recently had a portrait session with Greta Thunberg.\nTake a look behind the scenes of his photo session with the climate activist at Standing Rock.\nShane Balkowitsch: Website | Facebook | Instagram\nMy Modern Met granted permission to feature photos by Shane Balkowitsch.\nRelated Articles:\n\u201cHow Dare You!\u201d: Greta Thunberg Makes Powerful Speech at UN Climate Action Summit\nComparing Greta Thunberg\u2019s First Climate Strike with Mass Demonstrations One Year Later\n11 Trailblazing Women in History You Need to Know\nPortraits of People Whose Traditional M\u0101ori Tattoos Disappear in Wet Plate Photos",

        "text": "Photographer Cancels Photo Mural of Greta Thunberg After Boycott Threats\nWet plate photographer Shane Balkowitsch has canceled plans to put up a mural of his portrait of climate activist Greta Thunberg after locals threatened to boycott the business in the building.\nThe portraits have received quite a bit of attention, and the portrait above, titled \u201cStanding For Us All,\u201d was donated by the photographer to the Library of Congress.\nBalkowitsch then came up with the idea of displaying it as a 7-foot-tall mural on the side of a building in downtown Bismarck, North Dakota.\n![](https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/02/murallocation-800x435.jpg)\n![](https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/02/GRETA11.jpg)\nEven though the project would have been funded by Balkowitsch himself, it seems many residents weren\u2019t fond of the idea.\nAfter securing permission from the building\u2019s owner and bakery tenant as well as an approval recommendation from the city planning staff, Balkowitsch got the idea featured by local news station KFYR-TV.\nThe station also shared the story on its Facebook page, but that\u2019s when things started getting contentious.\nThe Facebook post was soon flooded by North Dakotans expressing displeasure about the planned mural. Most of the 1,200 comments published thus far seem to be critical of the idea.\nOther comments mentioned boycotting the business, Brick Oven Bakery, or vandalizing the mural once it was put up. Unwilling to put the business at risk for the mural, Balkowitsch and the bakery quickly withdrew their mural application.\nThe photographer says that the mural was more about art and history than politics.\n\u201cThere was no motivation other than install a very important piece of history that was captured here in North Dakota, in Bismarck \u2014 but I guess Bismarck doesn\u2019t want it,\u201d Balkowitsch tells The Bismarck Tribune. \u201cI feel for the bakery. I can\u2019t have some business being threatened for my work.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a picture of a 17-year-old girl; that\u2019s all it is to me. Her message and stuff, that\u2019s her message. As an artist, it\u2019s my duty to capture the history surrounding her, and the fact that she came to North Dakota, and the reservation down at Standing Rock.\u201d",

        "text": "Greta Thunberg reflects on living through multiple crises in a 'post-truth society'\nIn an interview with National Geographic, the teen climate activist considers the successes of the youth climate movement and the challenges it will face.\n![greta thunberg environmental activist](https://i.natgeofe.com/n/37853497-a35e-44b7-b77d-f6959e6a8879/01_greta-tintin-eleanora-ernman-thunberg---greta-10-8-2019--3327--high-resolution-.jpg)\nThis portrait is titled \u201cGreta.\u201d\nSince her first sit-in outside the Swedish parliament building more than two years ago, Greta Thunberg\u2019s fundamental message has been clear and unchanging: The climate crisis is humanity\u2019s greatest existential threat and we need to treat it as such. That message inspired millions of young activists to protest for change and led to a series of viral speeches that have defined Thunberg\u2019s global fame. She was Time\u2019s 2019 Person of the Year and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize two years in a row.\nNow, though, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014a global crisis of a much different nature\u2014and the looming threat of the U.S. backing out of the Paris Agreement, the 17-year-old activist is back at school in Sweden. National Geographic spoke with Thunberg via Zoom about how her activism has changed over the past year, and how her message might survive an increasingly complex world. (This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity).\nOliver Whang: A lot has happened in the past half year or so. How has your work changed since the coronavirus hit?\nGreta Thunberg: Well, we have moved from lots of physical things, meetings and strikes and so on, to doing it digitally. But, I mean, since we are a movement of people who don't fly because of the environmental impact, we haven't had to change that much in the way we work. And then every country, every local group, differs. Because we are a very decentralized movement. We are not run top-down, but every local group decides on their own what they're going to do. So it's been different from city to city, from country to country.\nOliver Whang: Have any of those countries or cities adapted in a way that's been really successful?\nGreta Thunberg: Yeah. Some do weekly digital strikes, which have been successful. And many have done symbolic actions. Some have put up signs or shoes outside the parliament buildings to symbolize that we should be here, but we are home. So there are lots of creative ways people have adapted.\nOliver Whang: Do you feel like the climate change crisis has been kind of forgotten in the middle of all this other stuff?\nGreta Thunberg: Well, that's a very poignant narrative because, yes, of course, as have all other issues. In an emergency like this, you have to expect that other things are going to be put on hold, as they have been.\nOliver Whang: One thing that's been striking to me about the worldwide response to the coronavirus pandemic is that a lot of countries and companies have made really big moves. Stimulus bills were passed and companies are developing vaccines quickly. Do you see this kind of response as inspiring some kind of action towards addressing the climate crisis?\nGreta Thunberg: Well, we shouldn't be comparing different crises, but it does show that we can treat a crisis like a crisis. And that it will probably change the way we perceive crises and crisis response. And it really proves that the climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis. It's just being treated as a public and important question, like a political topic. Which it is not, because it's an existential crisis.\nOliver Whang: But has the response to the coronavirus given you more hope? As in, we can have a similar response to the climate crisis?\nGreta Thunberg: It confirmed what I already knew. That once we treat the climate crisis like a crisis, we can change things and we can achieve things.\nOliver Whang: Here in the U.S., an election is coming up and our country is scheduled to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on November 4th. Our president has been promising to do this for years\u2014he says that the accord is unfair to America. And there are a lot of people, not most of the people in the U.S., but a lot of them, who agree with the president and agree with that decision to withdraw from the accord. What would you say to those people?\nGreta Thunberg: Nothing. Just as I always do, refer to the science. Because people have been trying to impact these people for so long, and they haven't succeeded. So why should I? Why should I be any different? If they don't listen to and understand and accept the science, then there's really nothing that I can do. There's something much deeper that needs to change them.\nOliver Whang: What might that deeper thing be?\nGreta Thunberg: That we live in a post-truth society today, and that we don't care that we have lost empathy. We have stopped caring for each other in a way. We have stopped thinking long-term and sustainable. And that's something that goes much deeper  than just climate crisis deniers.\nOliver Whang: So do you think in order to address the climate crisis, we might need like a cultural shift or a paradigm shift rather than just passing carbon taxes and legislation, influencing leaders and developing technology?\nGreta Thunberg: Well if I say that, then people will take that quote out of context and say that I want a revolution or something. But I mean the climate crisis is not the only problem here. It is just a symptom of a larger crisis. Like the loss of biodiversity, acidification of the oceans, and loss of fertile soil, and so on. And these things will not just be solved by stopping our emissions of greenhouse gases. The earth is a very complex system. If you take one thing and put it out of balance then that will have an impact on things beyond our comprehension. And that goes for equality as well. Humans are part of nature, and if we are not doing well, then nature is not doing well, because we are nature.\nThere are no arguments left. There are no excuses left. Now, it's just, either you try to minimize the crisis or just completely deny it, or you try to distract.Greta Thunberg\n![](https://i.natgeofe.com/n/923d25f7-2a1f-4711-a800-91a2cdfc0a28/02_greta-tintin-eleanora-ernman-thunberg---standing-for-us-all-10-8-2019--3328--high-resolution----additional-editing.jpg)\nThunberg poses for a photo, \u201cStanding For Us All.\u201d\nOliver Whang: Does it bother you that you might be missing all these people who maybe accept that climate change is a thing and that it's a crisis, but prioritize joblessness or access to food or other domestic issues over the climate crisis? Do you feel like you're missing them?\nGreta Thunberg: No, it doesn't bother me. We have not been made aware of the climate crisis\u2014the climate crisis has never been treated as a crisis, so how can we expect people to care about it? Since we are not aware of even the basic facts, how can we expect people to want climate action? And so that is something that needs to change. We need to understand that we are not fighting for separate causes. We are fighting for one and the same cause even though it might not seem like it. It's the fight for climate justice, social justice. Whatever is the issue, it\u2019s the fight for justice.\nOliver Whang: Do you think that we've made any significant progress towards addressing the climate crisis since you started protesting more than two years ago?\nGreta Thunberg: It depends on how you see it. In one way, yes. It feels like the debate has shifted and more and more people are starting to slowly understand the climate crisis more and prioritizing it. But on the other hand, it has still never once been treated as a crisis. And the emissions are still rising. So it depends on how you see it.\nBut I mean we can't expect that this one movement will change the world. If we think that is the case then we have not understood the climate crisis. People are like, \u2018Has your movement failed since you have not accomplished your goals?\u2019 But, I mean, what are our goals? We don't have any goals. Our goal is to do as much as we possibly can to be a small part of a very big shift. To be one of countless of activists who push in the same direction from different perspectives. And that is our goal. We can't expect one movement or one initiative, one solution, to change everything, or to put us in the right direction. Because the climate crisis is very complex. It's not just that simple.\nOliver Whang: Was there anything that you did or that other youth climate activists have done that you think has been particularly successful? Or any sort of manifestation of what you've done in policy or in the economy that you think is an example of your success?\nGreta Thunberg: Yes, we have many. Especially local examples. But I think the biggest thing that we have accomplished is to put the focus on the science. We just say, \u2018We don't want you to listen to us, we want you to listen to the science.\u2019 This not a question about politics, this is not our opinion. We don't want the emissions to reduce, it's what the science says is needed if we are to stay in line with our commitments. We don't want things to be like this. But unfortunately, that's where we are. And we will continue to push for people to listen to the science.\nOliver Whang: Do you ever have any doubts about your work? Do you ever doubt yourself or what you've been doing?\nGreta Thunberg: No, because I know it's the right thing to do. We are at a time now where we must step out of our comfort zones. I feel like I have a moral duty to do what I can, since I'm a citizen. And that makes me part of something and it is my duty, my moral duty, my moral responsibility, to do everything I can.\nOliver Whang: And that's never been in question for you?\nGreta Thunberg: No. I mean, I don't want to be an activist. I don't think any climate activist does it because they want to. We do this just because no one else is doing anything, and because we need to do somethin g. Someone needs to do something, and we are somebodies.\nOliver Whang: I'm curious if you feel like your moral duties or your responsibility has changed as you\u2019ve become this more recognized name.\nGreta Thunberg: Well, yes. Of course everyone has a responsibility, but the bigger your platform, the bigger your responsibility. And the bigger your power, the bigger your responsibility. The bigger your carbon footprint, the bigger your moral duty. So of course, as I've gotten a bigger platform that also comes with a bigger responsibility. I must use these channels, or whatever you would call them, to educate, to spread awareness.\nAnd the things, all the resources I have, they will disappear one day. I mean, I won't be this person for a long time. Soon people will lose interest in me and I won't be so-called \u201cfamous\u201d anymore. And then I will have to do something else. So I'm trying to, as long as I have this platform, use it.\nOliver Whang: How do you see yourself proceeding from here? Do you want to go to university? Do you have any plans?\nGreta Thunberg: Well, I don't really know. I just do what I want to do at the moment. And right now, I just started gymnasium (Editor\u2019s note: \u201cgymnasium\u201d is the Swedish equivalent of high school). And there I will be for the following three years. And unless I want to do something else, I mean, we will see. The world changes from day to day. So you just have to adapt, I guess.\nOliver Whang: How do you plan on sustaining this movement? Are there specific things we need to do that are different from what needed to be done two years ago or one year ago or eight months ago?\nGreta Thunberg: I mean, it's very complex. But right now we have kind of hit the wall. There are no arguments left. There are no excuses left. Now, it's just, either you try to minimize the crisis or just completely deny it, or you try to distract. We just need to start treating the crisis like a crisis and continue to lift up the science, but now everyone's blaming each other and we are stuck in a loop. We won't get anywhere unless someone breaks that chain, so to speak. Someone needs to do something. I mean, of course, many people have to do lots of things, but unless someone with a big platform or big responsibility does something to start treating the crisis like a crisis\u2014for instance, the media\u2014then we won't be able to move from here.",

        "text": "This just in: Greta Thunberg is not a time traveller\nVintage photo sparks wild theories online\nLook closely at this 121-year-old photo of three kids mining gold in Yukon and what do you see?\nWait a second, is that Greta Thunberg?\nWe hate to break it to you, but \u201cthat is not Greta Thunberg,\u201d said James Stack, a reference librarian at the University of Washington, where the photo came from.\nStack said they have the negative and the original print in their collection, which is named after the photographer who took the image back in 1898, Eric A. Hegg.\nThe resemblance is all just a strange coincidence.\nBut that didn\u2019t stop the time traveller theories from picking up steam on Twitter!\nStack \u2014 who said he answered the phone all morning on Thursday, fielding questions about the Greta look-alike \u2014 isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s skeptical of the time traveller theory.\nSome said if Greta was truly a time traveller, she wouldn\u2019t bother going out of her way to find green modes of transportation in 2019.\nThe 16-year-old climate activist has made a point of travelling across the world in a sustainable way.\nShe\u2019s currently hitching a ride from the U.S. to the UN Climate Change Conference in Spain on a sailboat operated by a couple of Australian YouTubers.\nOthers said the time traveller theory simply didn\u2019t go far enough.\nSome of the real keeners wanted to discuss the environmental impact of time travel technology.\nApparently, this isn\u2019t the first time a celebrity has discovered a doppelg\u04d3nger from the past.\nDoppelg\u04d3nger is a German word for look-alike.\nCBC Kids News reached out to Greta to see what she thought of the doppelg\u04d3nger theory.\nWe haven\u2019t heard back yet.\nBut Fridays For Future International, the group that helps organize school strikes worldwide, did respond.\nThe girl in the old picture \u201creally looks like Greta,\u201d said the authors of the email, Bengt and Lena, but there are \u201cso many people all over the world\u201d who have look-alikes.\nWhy shouldn't Greta have \u201cone or several\u201d look-alikes, too?\nThat said, Bengt and Lena wrote that Greta and the Fridays for Future volunteers believe it is important to listen to science.\n\u201cAs far as we know there is no scientific evidence for the existence of so-called time travellers,\u201d they said.",

Following in the footsteps of Edward S. Curtis and Orlando Scott Goff, Balkowitsch pays homage to his home state and its Native American heritage and culture.

Each image contains not only the moment it was taken, but the time in which it was taken.

        "description": "After 'Brazil' was released in Europe, Terry Gilliam came into conflict with the studio before the US release, so he used covert screenings in his favour.",
        "text": "![\u2018Brazil\u2019 Terry Gilliam](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2023/02/\u2018Brazil-Terry-Gilliam-1140x855.jpg)\n\u2018Brazil\u2019: Terry Gilliam, covert screenings and a very public battle with Universal Pictures\nAlthough Terry Gilliam has produced many memorable movies, including the likes of Time Bandits and 12 Monkeys, his masterpiece is undoubtedly the 1985 effort Brazil. A sharp satire of modern life set in a dystopian future where bureaucracy and surveillance keep humanity enslaved, it is a spiritual successor to George Orwell\u2019s distinguished warning against authoritarianism \u2013 1984.\nBrazil follows the story of Jonathan Pryce\u2019s low-ranking bureaucrat, Sam Lowry, who endeavours to break free from the chains of the system whilst and find a mysterious woman who keeps appearing in his dreams. As well as having clear Orwellian themes, Gilliam\u2019s film is also noted for its Kafka-esque stylings and absurd essence, with the depiction of a dystopian future one of the most terrifying in cinema.\nOne fascinating aspect of Brazil\u2018s story is Gilliam\u2019s tense battle with the studio, Universal Pictures, over the US release. Although the movie had already been distributed in Europe via 20th Century Fox in February 1985, Universal demanded a shorter version with a more straightforward ending for the US audience. \u201cListen, Sid,\u201d Gilliam reportedly said in response to Sidney Sheinberg, the chairman of Universal. \u201cThe film we made is the film we all agreed to make. If you want to make another film, you have my support. Just put your name on it.\u201d Understandably, the comment caused a stir.\nNot stopping there, Gilliam went public with what Universal Pictures were attempting to do to his film, telling journalists who were sympathetic to his cause. In a stroke of genius, he also placed an advert in Variety that directly asked Sheinberg when he would release Brazil. However, both actions violated a gag order in his contract with the studio, which strangely restricted him from criticising their business operations in public. Famously, Sheinberg would also speak publicly about the dispute, running a counter advertisement in Daily Variety offering to sell the movie.\nHowever, his opponent was Terry Gilliam, a member of the anti-establishment troupe Monty Python, and he would not back down. Duly, he opted to show the movie in clandestine screenings for local critics and film schools, which violated Universal\u2019s contracted right to sole distribution. He and producer Arnon Milchan even debated renting cinemas in Mexico and ferrying Americans across the border in buses. Luckily for the pair, who only wanted their unadulterated cut of Brazil shown in America, the covert screenings would help turn the tide against Universal.\nThe Los Angeles Film Critics Association named Brazil \u2018Best Picture\u2019, with their sister organisations in New York, Washington, Boston, and Chicago all doing the same. Understanding that the Brazil Gilliam and Milchan wanted to release was a hit, Universal changed their stance and released it in all its original glory in December 1985. It eventually won two BAFTAs and was nominated for two Oscars.",

        "description": "If science fiction is at its best when using imaginative scenarios to explore the problems of society, then Terry Gilliam's Brazil fits the bill.",
        "text": "There are plenty of film lovers who would not consider the 1985 dystopian classic, Brazil, a science fiction film. One of them is the creative genius behind the film, writer and director Terry Gilliam. In a 2014 interview with the British Film Institute, he was asked how much science fiction played a part in his early life. Was he a science fiction fan?\nNot really. Well, no, that\u2019s not true. The ones that really got me going were like Kubrick, with 2001, the really intelligent ones that seemed to be talking about things. I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the monster ones; they tended to be silly.\nWhat about those who consider his film Brazil a science fiction film?\nI find it very odd that people think it should be in the science fiction section, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s science fiction. At the time, it was more of a documentary, as far as I was concerned, about the world it seemed we were living in.\nIs Brazil Sci-Fi?\n![A woman\u2019s face is pulled as a beauty procedure in Brazil](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/32BD2E92-A808-4C06-A23D-3974D0D21FB4.jpeg)\nWhich is exactly why Brazil is such a brilliant filmmaking achievement, and one of the compelling reasons why it might just meet the criteria of great science fiction. To use Gilliam\u2019s own words, the film is really intelligent, and seems to be talking about things, as good science fiction should. But on top of that, it features architecture and technology beyond time and ordinary imagination. That the style is extremely eclectic, and the story has no defining date only adds to the technological wonder, a quality essential to science fiction. Gilliam continued:\nI was trying to make it in no place at all, neither future, nor past. A mixture. And there had been so many space films \u2014 I didn\u2019t want it to look like that. So, it was trying to make it retro, so it could be taking place in the \u201850s, like Popular Science magazines [...] or later. It didn\u2019t matter.\nAdd in a cold, dark, dystopian background and the result is a movie that can easily be compared to movies like Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey or Ridley Scott\u2019s Blade Runner, both intellectual science fiction masterpieces. But perhaps there\u2019s an even stronger link that nudges Brazil into the nebulous realm of science fiction.\nGreat Science Fiction Is About Political Threats to Human Decency\n![Brazil Interrogation](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/brazilinterrogation.jpg)\nConsider any list of the greatest science fiction movies of all time. Whether it\u2019s a list of ten movies or a hundred, it\u2019s difficult to find a film that isn\u2019t built on a foundation of political concerns. The core conflict in almost all science fiction is a political threat to human decency. Let's examine this in four of the most appealing and popular science fiction stories of the past half century:\nStar Wars\n![Ian McDiarmid in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1983)](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/palpatine-article-(1).jpg)\nPerhaps the most popular science fiction universe ever has politics built right into its name. The \u201cWars\u201d of Star Wars, of course, refers to the ever-present backstory of the fall of a galactic republic to a powerful emperor, which leads to a rebellion whose goal is to end tyranny and oppression. The many players \u2014 senators, Sith, Jedi, and clones \u2014 and their many tools \u2014 blasters, lightsabers, TIE fighters, and death stars \u2014 all come and go, but political purposes and intrigue drive every story from beginning to end. This was highlighted at its best in the recent Star Wars series Andor.\nDune\n![Timothee Chalamet in Dune](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/timothee-chalamet-dune.jpeg)\nThe founding fathers of science fiction might have set the tone of sci-fi movies by making their stories vehicles for social and political commentary. Frank Herbert\u2019s universe of Dune explores the deep end of the political pool. It's a story that has Great Houses established on planets that jostle for prominence within the Imperium, which is ruled by military might and the strict control of interplanetary travel and economics, while factions with opposing philosophies secretly advance technology and genetics programs to increase their power and influence. The heroes and villains alike are caught in this complex, inescapable political web.\nStar Trek\n![Captain Picard as Locutus of Borg](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Picard-as-Locutus-of-Borg-1200x630.jpg)\nOf all the huge science fiction franchises, this is the universe that one would expect to leave political concerns behind for the sake of scientific exploration. Even the Federation\u2019s prime directive seems to want to keep starships uninvolved. But the prime directive is itself a political mandate that repeatedly comes with its own set of troubles, and more stories than not revolve around humans, Klin gons, Romulans, Cardassians, the Borg, the Dominion, the Xindi, the Breen, and Vidiians all trying to maintain or shift the balance of power in one quadrant or another.\nAlien\n![Ian Holm, in character as an android, lies nearly destroyed during a scene from \"Alien\" (1979).](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Holm_Alien_1979_20th_Century_Fox.jpg)\nEven the monster-based science fiction movies that Terry Gilliam might think of as silly are steeped in politics. The universe of Alien movies could have had stories that are all simple, apolitical thrillers, but that\u2019s not the case. From the beginning, Ridley Scott\u2019s 1979 thriller Alien is not just about the struggle to survive the monster that got on board, it\u2019s also about why the monster is on board. The Company\u2019s weapons division already knew what was on LV-426, and would do anything for control of the ultimate biological weapon. The crew is expendable in the face of profits and military might.\nBrazil\u2019s Extraordinary Social and Political Insight\n![Politics in Brazil movie from Terry Gilliam](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/politics-in-brazil-movie-from-terry-gilliam.jpg)\nBrazil does have elements of mainstream science fiction, things like an angelic suit of winged armor, or an exoskeletal device to enhance (or perhaps, control) finger dexterity while using a keyboard, or an intrusive security robot with a telescoping eye that prowls the halls of the Ministry of Information, among many other things. But it\u2019s still a decidedly grounded movie. Flying only happens in dreams. There are no spacecrafts or beam weapons, no twin suns or planetary rings. And outside of dreams, there is nothing more inhuman than the very worst of humanity.\nBut as truly great science fiction often is, it might just be a prophetic (and terrifying) vision of where the human race could be headed. The place Brazil challenges reality is not in advanced technology or extraterrestrial biology: it warns of a coming world where every detail of human life is controlled by corporate and political bureaucracies. In such a world, information becomes a weapon that is used to punish whoever thinks the wrong thoughts or says the wrong things. As Gilliam points out in the aforementioned interview, there are real parallels to our world today:\nHomeland Security is the Ministry of Information, and if you can\u2019t find terrorists, you invent terrorists. If you listen into enough people\u2019s conversation, you\u2019ll probably find somebody who had a terroristic thought in their head for a moment.\nCould our 21st century culture have arrived at this place of aggressive control already? Not just governmental security agencies, but in the corporate workplace? Are people being treated differently for what they believe, or for something they may have emailed or tweeted in their past, some piece of information that someone went to great trouble to dig up? It has to be admitted that social media has somehow become a war zone in our real world, and much of it revolves around demonizing those who are different.\nThe Depth of Brazil Is Astounding\n![Brazil sci-fi movie Computer Screen](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/brazil-sci-fi-movie-computer-screen.jpg)\nBrazil also has something to say about cultural values. A pivotal moment happens when the protagonist, Sam Lowry, who is absolutely not a terrorist by any reasonable definition, is arrested for being a terrorist. As he is strapped to an interrogation chair with instruments of torture all around, a compassionate armed guard whispers, \u201cDon\u2019t fight it, son. Confess quickly. If you hold out too long, you\u2019ll jeopardize your credit rating.\u201d\nThis is the kind of incredible satire one would expect from a member of Monty Python, and it\u2019s hard not to laugh out loud, but it\u2019s also one of the most telling lines in the film. In the context of a single breath, the most minor of characters communicates the nightmare inhumanity that can grow in systems of social control, the necessity of those having to support such systems to hide their humanity, the choice between compliance and harm that individuals who don\u2019t keep in line have to face, and the system\u2019s true measure of the values that everyone knowingly or unknowingly subscribes to, like eternal youth or credit ratings.\nIf Brazil can be considered science fiction, it should be considered one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. The design and direction of Terry Gilliam has produced a world unlike any other, and at the same time, something frighteningly and intimately familiar. The wonderful performances of Jonathan Pryce, Ian Holm, and Robert De Niro are brilliant, fun, tragic, and strangely heartwarming. And finally, the film\u2019s disturbing vision of a cold, controlled life of social boundaries and stifling bureaucracy is a warning that should be taken seriously.",

        "description": "The Saturday Auteur",
        "text": "The Saturday Auteur\nA founding member of the Monty Python crew, Terry Gilliam\u2019s fantasy creations were often the most bonkers of the utterly bonkers comedy troupe, and would later evolve into a far-out, surreal filmography like no other.\nBorn in Minnesota, Gilliam moved to London in the late 60s, defecting from America as a fuck you to the rising tide of authoritarianism in the US and police brutality, and naturalised to British citizenship in 1968. It\u2019s here, in swingin\u2019 London that Gilliam began working with the Python crew, creating brilliantly absurdist comedy. Beginning as the Python\u2019s animator and illustrator for LPs and book covers, Gilliam\u2019s responsibility soon evolved to full membership with co-writing credits, while his wacky animations would become a defining aspect of the group\u2019s aesthetic.\nGilliam\u2019s cinematic breakthrough came via Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Co-directed by Gilliam with fellow Python Terry Jones, the flick was an irreverent take on the King Arthur legend that included classic scenes like the Knights who say Nee, the Rabbit of Caerbannog and the never-beaten Black Knight. Blending historical and societal accuracy with visionary surrealism and sharp humour, this experience became a fundamental stepping stone in Gilliam\u2019s M.O.\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail by Terry Gilliam, 1975\nVia his world-building imagination, some of Gilliam\u2019s finest works have come in the realm of science fiction, taking place in futuristic, dystopian landscapes \u2013 affording him the opportunity to forge bizarre, fantastic and horrifying worlds that reflect our own through a warped angle.\nYou can\u2019t see the dystopian metropolis that populates Gilliam\u2019s 1985 classic Brazil without considering the vast, ever-encompassing cityscapes of the world\u2019s cities and the bureaucratic coldness that follows. Or the film\u2019s portrayal of a society dominated by censorship and bureaucracy that presses on the wound of our own. Or even better, watch Gilliam\u2019s time-travel sci-fi flick, Twelve Monkeys now \u2013set around a devastating pandemic \u2013 and fresh poignancy is clear. Let\u2019s all hope that prisoner James Cole (Bruce Willis) is currently racing through time to try and solve things like in the film \u2013 also starring Brad Pitt as a patient and animal rights activist locked in an insane asylum. Through these sci-fi worlds, Gilliam was able to confront and dissect societal topics of totalitarianism, machinery, and conformity (refer back to the reasons he left America mentioned earlier).\nSpeaking of surreal characters, now we come to Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s role in Gilliam\u2019s story, and the filmmaker\u2019s cult adaption of the writer\u2019s 1971 novel, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. A stream-of-altered-consciousness report of journalist Raoul Duke (read: Thompson) and his attorney Dr Gonzo on a trip to Las Vegas armed with an arsenal of hallucinatory drugs. Bringing the story to the big screen with help from stunning performances by Johnny Depp as Duke and Benicio Del Toro as Dr Gonzo, Gilliam shaped a world of psychedelic hedonism and danger that perfectly captured the madness of Thompson\u2019s story.\nBrazil by Terry Gilliam, 1985\nDealing with concepts of time, madness, technology and societal breakdown, 12 Monkeys was one of only several films Gilliam made on American soil \u2013 shot on location in Philadelphia and Baltimore in early 1995.\nThe plot centres around convict, James Cole (Bruce Willis), who is sent back in time from 2035 to discover the origin of a deadly virus which has wiped out most of the planet\u2019s population and left the survivors taking refuge underground (above ground, the planet has been reclaimed by animals). Accidentally arriving in 1990 instead of 1996, Cole lands in an asylum where he meets inmate Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), whose story intertwines with Goines\u2019 mission.\nWith signature Gilliam plot twists and a future world that doesn\u2019t look so foreign today, the work remains a crucial watch on the way to understanding Gilliam\u2019s encompassing vision.\n12 Monkeys by Terry Gilliam, 1995\nBringing to life Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s counterculture epic of the same name about his \u2018true\u2019 road trip story to Vegas with his psychotic lawyer and their mind-altering escapades that ensued, is no mean feat. Previous to Gilliam\u2019s adaptation, both Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone had tried to get the film off the ground with no luck, and it was only after many extensions that the production company finally landed on Gilliam.\nWith Johnny Depp playing Thompson\u2019s alter-ego, Raoul Duke, (the two became close friends following this film and Thompson was the one who shaved Depp\u2019s hair in his own image) and Benicio del Toro as his attorney Dr Gonzo, the madcap pair are brought to life in a tripped-out story riddled with nightmarish trips, surreal confusion and vivid lizard hallucinations. A master of the abstract, Gilliam perfectly captured that disorientating feeling of being uncomfortably high in a situation you shouldn\u2019t be in, with camera shots vibrating be tween awkward angles, close-ups and transient swipes.\nThe film initially received mixed reviews from critics and was a financial failure, however, that was never the point: in ode to Thompson, here was a piece of work that stuck a middle finger up at commercial approval. Gonzo journalism had hit the big screen, and it was wild.\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Terry Gilliam, 1998\nWhat to watch by Terry Gilliam:",

        "text": "Summary:\nAn everyman of an oppressively bureaucratic future becomes entangled in a conspiracy after a clerical error.\nMy Thoughts:\nBefore I get started, let me say that I have been dreading writing this review.\n\u2018Why?\u2019 You ask. \u2018Brazil is a great movie!\u2019\nIndeed, Brazil is a great movie. It is my favorite Gilliam film, and Gilliam is easily one of my favorite directors. For the longest time, Brazil sat comfortably in my Top Five Movies list, but only recently it was bumped from its position (replaced by Fellini\u2019s \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d). This movie is still in my top ten films. It has meant so much to me for so long, that I doubt it will ever leave my top ten. So, I state again: I\u2019ve been dreading writing this review. Why? Because I know no matter what I say about this movie, it will never be enough to convey my love for it. I could write an article just on the production design of this film, another article on the layered symbolism of Sam Lowry\u2019s (Jonathan Pryce, \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d) dreams, another article on the bleakness of the ending, and probably a dozen articles about how this movie compares to George Orwell\u2019s classic novel, 1984.\nI won\u2019t do that. Instead, I\u2019ll do my best to convey to you, dear reader, what it is \u201cBrazil\u201d means to a huge fan, and why I think every cinephile, regardless of what genres they prefer, should see this film.\n\u201cThis is your receipt for your husband, and this is my receipt for your receipt.\u201d\nBrazil is set in an alternate timeline/distant future where mindless bureaucracy bogs down society and terror attacks are so prevalent the whole world has become numb to them. After a clerical error mislabels an innocent man named \u2018Buttle\u2019 a terrorist, a depressed government worker named Sam Lowry (Pryce) is sent to clean up the mess. When Lowry arrives at Buttle\u2019s apartment building, he comes in contact with Jill Layton (Kim Greist, \u201cManhunter\u201d), a woman whom he\u2019s been having dreams about. Meanwhile, Harry Tuttle (Robert Deniro, \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d), a renegade repairman, contacts Lowry, while the government begins to suspect that Lowry himself might be behind the terrorist attacks.\nSo I suppose first and foremost: this movie is sort of a Gilliam-ized version of George Orwell\u2019s 1984, a book which has, more or less, has been labeled the epitome of dystopian fiction (in my opinion it\u2019s a tossup between 1984 or Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World- both are great, but they\u2019re very different). As I sat down to write this review, I found a bit of trivia on IMDb that said Gilliam himself had admitted that \u201cBrazil\u201d was in part inspired by 1984, but Gilliam had not, in fact, ever read the book. I\u2019m sure if you haven\u2019t read the book, much like Gilliam, you probably are at least aware of what the story is about.\nOrwell\u2019s 1984 tells the story of cold, calculated world where the world is seemingly perfect, but there are little hints that there is something wrong beneath the surface. In 1984, the protagonist is named Winston Smith, and he is a middle-aged government worker that specializes in \u2018doublethink\u2019 and \u2018doublespeak\u2019, government coined-phrases that were invented to describe the rewriting of history so that it seems the country in which Smith lives, has always been on the right side of history. In Terry Gilliam\u2019s \u201cBrazil,\u201d Sam Lowry\u2019s character is a government worker responsible for the processing of all sorts of various goings on (his actual job title is kept pretty vague, we just know he\u2019s a government worker, and from the way his mother pesters him about a promotion, we can deduce that he holds a low to moderate rank). In both worlds, nothing seems to really get done because everything is bogged down by so much paperwork and needless proceedings.\nThere are honestly dozens of ways that the two stories correlate, from the romantic elements (Sam Lowry\u2019s relationship with Jill Layton becomes Lowry\u2019s driving force to break from the bureaucracy, just like Winston\u2019s relationship with Julia becomes his driving force to revolt against the ministry), to the growing coldness of humanity (Brazil shows this in the indifference to terrorist attacks, while 1984 shows this in the governments belief that sex should only be used for reproduction), to the bleak yet similar endings (which I won\u2019t spoil). But the thing I love about Gilliam is that he makes this story uniquely his own, in only the way Gilliam can do it.\nGilliam\u2019s directing style is, to say the least, a little bit bonkers. While I wont say all of his films are great, all of his films have at least a few things that I can point to and say, \u201cI like the way he did that.\u201d His films can be absolutely ridiculous (\u201cMonty Python and the Holy Grail\u201d, \u201cTime Bandits\u201d, \u201cFear and Loathing in Las Vegas\u201d), they can be sentimental and thought provoking (\u201cThe Fisher King\u201d), they can be thrilling (\u201cTwelve Monkeys\u201d), or they can tell stories I believe only Gilliam could tell (\u201cThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen\u201d, \u201cThe Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\u201d). Gilliam, in my opinion, is truly  a cinematic treasure, and his genre films have opened the doors for and inspired a whole new generation of fantasy filmmakers. Brazil is one of Gilliam\u2019s films where I believe his talents are on full display; the movie is equal parts thought provoking, satirical, and compelling, and no, I don\u2019t think this film could\u2019ve been made by anyone else.\nI think the thing Gilliam does the best in this film is balancing the craziness with the message he\u2019s trying to tell. The world that Gilliam crafts is fantastical, yet we never loose ourselves in the bizarre goings on of the world. On the TMM podcast, we\u2019ve often talked about how in good films, setting becomes just as big of a character as the protagonists, and \u201cBrazil\u201d accomplishes that perfectly. The first time we meet Lowry, as he\u2019s getting ready for work in the morning, we watch as all of the mechanics around him, which are meant to make his life easier, end up malfunctioning and doing nothing to help him in the long run. That introductory scene sets the tone for the whole world by showing the viewer how futuristic and new everything is, but at the same time, showing how horribly these machines function. The world is further fleshed out by Lowry\u2019s relationship with his mother, Mrs. Ida Lowry (Katherine Helmond, \u201cTime Bandits\u201d), whom is obsessed with getting multiple plastic surgeries from a quack doctor (Jim Broadbent, \u201cLife is Sweet\u201d), and keeping up with the latest fashion trends (like wearing shoes on one\u2019s head). Gilliam seems to love to point out the ridiculousness of these passing trends by making everything overblown and silly, juxtaposed by how serious the actors treat the world.\nAnother thing I love about this film is how scarily accurate some of the predictions about the coldness of society have turned out to be. There is one scene in particular where Lowry has dinner with his mother, and, upon sitting down at the restaurant a bomb goes off, killing dozens of patrons on the other side of the building. Not to be deterred from their meal, Sam, his mother, and his mother\u2019s guests, talk to their waiter and ask to order, whilst people in the background wail and moan in pain. The scene is darkly comedic, but it also points at the characters\u2019 indifference to the suffering of others around us. How many times today how we heard about terrorist attacks in different parts of the world, and simply thought, \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely terrible,\u201d and gone about our day? I know I\u2019m guilty of it. We all are. Are any of us any different than Sam and his mother, going about our daily lives while people wail in agony behind us?\nWhile Gilliam is absolutely trying to make a point with this film, I actually find it to be one of his more entertaining films as well. The movie never feels like I\u2019m getting a kind of message crammed down my throat, Gilliam is just telling a story. If you\u2019re sick of politics, don\u2019t worry; there\u2019s enough escapist fun in this film for viewers to enjoy this on multiple levels.\nVerdict:\n\u201cBrazil\u201d is a brilliant film. I personally would argue it\u2019s Gilliam\u2019s best, but he has so many other great films that I could understand any number of his films being toted as the director\u2019s magnum opus. Brazil is a hard film to describe, and while the surface-level story is easy to grasp, the elaborate intricacies of the symbolism and the depth of the world building, make it easy to come back to this film multiple times and catch something new every time.\nI absolutely recommend \u201cBrazil.\u201d\nReview Written By:",

        "description": "Monty Python member Terry Gilliam has established himself as one of the most vibrant, imaginative, and surreal directors of all time.",
        "text": "Some directors spend their careers largely occupying one genre or another, some however manage to avoid being pigeonholed and create a diverse and eclectic body of work in the process. Throughout his career, Terry Gilliam has crafted films that are sometimes comical, scary, fantastical, and sometimes a mix of all these elements combined. Gilliam rose to prominence initially as a member of the Monty Python collective before venturing into his own feature length films.\nHis profile increased with films such as Time Bandits, Brazil, and 12 Monkeys, among others. Gilliam has long been considered to be one of the most influential and dynamic filmmakers of our time, and his body of work more than represents his tremendous range. With more than a few classics to his name, Gilliam has plenty of popular films, and we've decided to rank his finest achievements. While these are all excellent (as is much of his work, like Tideland and The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus), read on to see which Gilliam film comes out on top.\n5 Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas\n![Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro smoke and smile at the camera in Fear and Loathing](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Fear-and-Loathing.jpg)\nLong labeled as an unfilmable novel and passed up by several directors, an adaption of Hunter S. Thompson's surreal and twisted commentary on America finally found its way to the big screen thanks to Gilliam in 1998. With its debauchery, lurid visuals, and kinetic pace, the subject of Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas was ideal for Gilliam's vibrant and genre-averse style. He depicts Las Vegas as an enticing yet nightmarish funhouse and films Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro's antics with a freewheeling glee and energy.\nWhat truly allows Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas to transcend itself is how Gilliam manages to find his own voice while still faithfully honoring Thompson's darkly comic yet insightful perspectives. Several sequences from the novel are translated to the screen with gusto and innovation, and Gilliam doesn't shy away from the novel's more uncompromising material.\nUpon release, Fear and loathing In Las Vegas wasn't well-received by critics and didn't quite perform at the box office as expected. Time has been kind to the film, however, and many have praised its faithfulness along with its imaginative visuals, absurd humor, and go-for-broke performances by Depp and Del Toro. Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas has since become a fan favorite and widely regarded in Gilliam's filmography, and is considered one of the best cult classics of the 90's.\n4 Time Bandits\n![The cast of Time Bandits huddle together](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/article/asQUu3wELI02IYcKYxsmV5M56Soujp.jpg)\nOne of his earliest films, Time Bandits sets the foundation for many of the trademarks Gilliam would explore throughout his career. As a film, Time Bandits may not be his most accomplished, but it's certainly one of his most purely enjoyable and is full of delightful visuals, sprinted performances, and Gilliam's signature absurdity in full effect. Time Bandits is a consistently entertaining romp and utilizes its concept for some truly inventive and hilarious material, managing to keep it all tightly paced and cohesive throughout. Elements of Gilliam's time with Monty Python are included here, but thankfully his own unique voice is present in many of the film's touches and influences, especially its incredibly dark ending.\nTime Bandits was met with a warm reception and over time has endured a positive reputation by Gilliam fans. As a film, it signaled the beginning of a promising career and showcased Gilliam's potential and emerging vision. While following films may have improved or exceeded upon it, Time Bandits remains an engaging and exciting showcase for Gilliam as a storyteller and is still fondly remembered 40 years since its release. Plus it has a delightful Sean Connery performance.\n3 The Fisher King\n![Robin Williams as a homeless man in Fisher King](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Fisher-King.png)\nDespite a career full of imaginative and surreal experiences, one of the boldest films in Gilliam's career is one of his most human. The Fisher King starring the late great Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges is a heartfelt, harrowing, and ultimately poignant exploration of grief, loss, friendship, and the devastating effects of schizophrenia. The film does contain elements of Gilliam's surreal visuals and typical combination of wacky fantasy with melancholic despair, but also emphasizes character in an understated manner and contains arguably Jeff Bridge's best performance and one of William's most moving and affecting turns as well.\nWhile based on Arthurian legend, Gilliam also grounds the film in genuine realism and allows the characterizations to remain front and center, while maintaining his dynamic storytelling techniques as well. Throughout  The Fisher King, Gilliam delves into fantasy, dark comedy, and drama, and while a lesser film with so much going on may appear uneven, in his hands it allows for a truly original and unique experience.\nThe Fisher King received strong critical attention, particularly for Gilliam's mature storytelling and the strong performances from Williams and Bridges, along with a show-stealing turn by Mercedes Raul (who won an Oscar for the film). In Gilliam's filmography, many consider The Fisher King one of his most underrated yet effective films and some even consider it his best along with telling an affecting tale of mental illness.\n2 12 Monkeys\n![Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis in a mental institution in 12 Monkeys](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/12-Monkeys.png)\nTime travel films are a dime a dozen these days, but leave it up to Terry Gilliam to turn the subgenre on its head. 12 Monkeys stars Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe, and involves Willis' character traveling through time to prevent a plague from wiping out more than half the population. The film takes on an unorthodox approach to time travel as it cuts back between multiple timelines, but thankfully Gilliam creates a gothic yet commanding atmosphere in this update of the great French New Wave short film La Jetee.\nThe film is filled to the brim with stunning visuals, suspense and plenty of surreal yet engaging trademarks that keep 12 Monkeys constantly engrossing. The film is also noteworthy for how Gilliam manages to juggle the moving bits while also allowing us to remain invested in the characters. Bruce Willis gives a restrained yet powerful performance and his relationship with Madeline Stowe's character adds depth and pathos; Pitt memorably steals every scene he's in with his over-the-top wackiness. As a cinematic experience, 12 Monkeys is exhilarating, surreal, and surprisingly human, and demonstrates Gilliam's ability to be accessible and artful at the same time.\nUpon release, 12 Monkeys was received favorably and was also a commercial success as well. The film inspired a television series of the same name and is widely regarded as one of the best sci-fi films of all time. Overall, 12 Monkeys stands as a triumph for Gilliam and still resonates today.\n1 Brazil\n![A woman's face gets stretched in Brazil](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Brazil.png)\nIn a career full of triumphs, Brazil is very much Terry Gilliam's magnum opus. Based loosely off of George Orwell's 1984, the film is a dystopian dark comedy starring Johnathan Pryce as mild-mannered Saw Lowry, whose inadvertent bureaucratic mix-up results in him getting involved in a conspiracy beyond what he could've imagined. Like much of Gilliam's output, the film is filled with quirky and memorable visuals, absurd humor, inventive set pieces, and an exuberant yet haunting tone.\nBrazil is chillingly relevant to today's world and Gilliam explores themes of consumerism, bureaucracy, and government control but with his trademark humor and wit present. Brazil also combines genres with elements of fantasy, satire, and sci-fi blending together to form a truly singular experience. Brazil has been considered a landmark for the genre and is commonly regarded as one of the best sci-fi films of all time. While Gilliam has made many films in his time, none have quite achieved the level of artistry he brings here. For that reason, Brazil remains his undisputed masterpiece and is still considered highly influential today.",

        "text": "\u201cSealion\u201d - Feist (Nina Simone)\nSpotify | Apple Music | YouTube Music | TIDAL | Amazon Music\nI first heard this song in high school. Admittedly, I was unfamiliar with the Nina Simone version at the time. Because the title of the song and its lyrics differ from the original, you could argue this isn\u2019t a cover (I would disagree with you, though). It\u2019s different enough. It\u2019s clear Feist is not trying to redo Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cSee-Line Woman.\u201d But I do really like that the Feist cover kept the percussive claps of the original.

When the song played during the opening, the melody sounded familiar and I went, \u201cOh, yeah. That song.\u201d I ended the movie thinking the song was written specifically for the 1985 film. Then I googled it. Well, I was wrong. It\u2019s a very old and very famous song that existed decades before Monty Python decided they wanted to be Monty Python. (In my head the guys of Monty Python met each and went, \u201cWait\u2026should we be Monty Python?\u201d)\nAnyway, this summer I was listening to a Cornelius album I\u2019d played a few times during the pandemic, except this time my ear was ready to receive and recognize the \u201cBrazil\u201d cover!\nI love the build in the intro.

        "description": "This one looks set to be as offensive as it is intriguing.",
        "text": "Fans of Johnny Depp have been watching his slow reintegration into Hollywood with interest in the years since his legal wrangling with Amber Heard came to a conclusion. While the actor has stayed away from the mainstream spotlight since then, he has been slowly building up a list of potential roles, one of which sees him playing Satan in the latest movie from visionary director Terry Gilliam . After a long period without any updates, it seems that the movie is still being worked on and is expected to start filming this year.\nOriginally entitled The Carnival at the End of Days, the film will now reportedly just run under the truncated title of Carnival. Considering Gilliam is behind such movies as The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnasus, the original title was not exactly out of character, but it looks like short and intriguing is now the name of the game.\n![A woman's face gets stretched in Brazil](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Brazil-(1).png)\nTerry Gilliam's Best Movies Ranked\nMonty Python member Terry Gilliam has established himself as one of the most vibrant, imaginative, and surreal directors of all time.\nThere have been rumors and reports about the project swirling for a long time now, without any truly concrete information being revealed. But in a recent interview with Box Office Biz, Italian producer Guglielmo Marchetti confirmed a long-awaited update on the project.\n\u201cThe next executive production that we will be working on at the beginning of 2025 is a real blockbuster that I am personally very proud of. After having handled the distribution of Doctor Parnassus in 2009, I am returning to work with one of the greatest directors in the world, the visionary Terry Gilliam who will direct a stellar cast: Johnny Depp, Jeff Bridges, Jason Momoa, Adam Driver, Asa Butterfield and Emma Laird. The work is titled Carnival and for the making of this film, a pool of Italian executive producers and several post-production companies will also be involved by the American producers. The Cinecitt\u00e0 sound stages will be used for the interiors and over 3,000 people will be employed in Italy in the making of the film.\u201d\n'Carnival' Continues Johnny Depp\u2019s Quiet Hollywood Return\n![Johnny Depp as Louis XV in Jeanne du Barry](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/johnny-depp-as-louis-xv-in-jeanne-du-barry.jpg)\nIn the last few years, Johnny Depp has appeared in the movie Jeanne Du Barry and directed Modi: Three Days on the Wings of Madness. While Depp is set to reunite with Blow co-star Pen\u00e9lope Cruz in Day Drinker, Carnival could turn out to be the most prominent of his recent roles, as he takes on the part of Satan alongside Jeff Bridges\u2019 God. However, as Gilliam previously revealed, people should be prepared to be offended by the depictions of biblical characters who may not be exactly as they are usually seen.\n\u201cHe won\u2019t be the God we\u2019re used to. In the film, God is nature. But a nature that can speak to you. I\u2019m going to need animation to bring it to life because in the scene with God, there are at least fifteen animals, and it\u2019s going to be complicated because it has to be realistic. And it\u2019s going to be very expensive, what will happen? But it\u2019s a good scenario. It will be very funny for those who like to be offended.\u201d\nThe logline for the movie reads, \u201cGod, disappointed with what\u2019s gone down on planet Earth, wants to wipe out Humanity and the only one who wants to save them is Satan, who convinces God that two young people he\u2019s found are the new Adam and Eve.\u201d This certainly seems likely to have some people up in arms, and the inclusion of Depp will cause some more flurries of controversy, so we can prepare to see plenty more about Carnival as production gets under way.\nSource: Box Office Biz\n![instar53647405.jpg](https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/01/instar53647405.jpg)\nJohnny Depp\n- Birthname\n- John Christopher Depp II\n- Birthdate\n- June 9, 1963\n- Birthplace\n- Owensboro, Kentucky, USA\nBio\nJohn Christopher Johnny Depp II born June 9 1963 is an American actor and musician He has won the Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild award for Best Actor Depp rose to prominence on the 1980s television series 21 Jump Street becoming a teen idol Turning to film he played the title character of Edward Scissorhands 1990 and later found box office success in films such as Sleepy Hollow 1999 Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl 2003 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 2005 and Rango 2011 He has collaborated with director and friend Tim Burton in seven films including Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street 2007 and Alice in Wonderland 2010 Depp has gained acclaim for his portrayals of people such as Edward D Wood Jr in Ed Wood Joseph D Pistone in Donnie Brasco Hunter S Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas George Jung in Blow and the bank robber John Dillinger in Michael Mann s Public Enemies  Films featuring Depp have grossed over 2 6 billion at the United States box office and over 6 billion worldwide He has been nominated for top awards many times winning the Best Actor Awards from the Golden Globes for Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and from the Screen Actors Guild for Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl He also has garnered a sex symbol status in American cinema being twice named as the Sexiest man alive by People magazine in 2003 and 2009",

        "text": "Arch\n443/646: Architecture and Film\nFall 2006\nBrazil\nDiscussion\nQuestions:\nPlease\nanswer the questions below. Use paragraph form. Your answer should\nbe around 400 words. Email me your responses in Word .doc format to:\ntboake@sympatico.ca I\nwill be posting these each week after the class. You should be prepared\nto deliver your answer in class -- but paraphrase, do not read it.\nThis week's\nquestion is intentionally a little bit different. Each question is comprise\nof 2 to 4 images, each from a different film. Look at the images and\ncontemplate why they were given. Your answer should relate the nature\nof the subjects of the images and films from which they were taken, together\n- with respect to Brazil as the main focus of your discussion - as\nwell as with respect to the general theme of the creation of dystopia\nin film environments.\nIf you have\nno idea which film the image is from... do an image \"save\" and it might\ngive you the title.\nupdated\n10-dec-06 1:26 PM\nnote:\nyour images are BELOW your name\n1.\nJody Patterson\nReligious symbolism in these films \u2013 Brazil\n, True Stories and Clockwork Orange \u2013 is\nused to illustrate the perversions of each particular society.\nEach scene, portrayed as a religious service, deviates from what\nwould be expected in this context and surprises the viewer, redefining\nwhat is to be considered \u2018sacred\u2019 in each society.\nIn Brazil the scene is Mrs. Terrain\u2019s\nfuneral, and the eulogy being pronounced before her portrait suggests\na preoccupation with being \u2018physically new\u2019 \u2013 indeed,\nit seems Mrs. Terrain has finally died from the series of post-plastic\nsurgery \u2018complications\u2019 which kept her crippled and\nbandaged throughout the film. A bandage end caught in the coffin\nlid foreshadows the horrific mutilated parts which spill from the\ncoffin at the end of the scene: Mrs. Terrain has sacrificed herself\nin the pursuit of youthful beauty. Mrs. Lowry\u2019s interventions\nwere obviously more successful: she sits with her back to the casket\nin order to flirt with a retinue of young men. When she turns toward\nSam she is revealed as a beautiful, much-younger woman and asks\nhim to stop calling her Mother. Thus Mrs. Lowry renounces her son\nin the same scene, for the social position she is so obviously\nenjoying after her restoration. Sacrifice for superficial gain\nseems to be the theme of the funeral scene, absurdly set in a place\nwhich is intended to represent an \u2018ultimate sacrifice\u2019.\nThis parody illustrates the distortion of morals and authentic\nself which Gilliam presents to be evident in a modern society like Brazil .\n2. Joel\nDiGiacomo\nAll three images refer to a common theme in dystopic\nstories: sex, or more generally speaking, love, is a threat to\na totalitarian power. It is an instinct, causing humans to behave\nirrationally, undermining the tight control the institution must\nimpose over the individual in order to sustain itself. In Brazil,\nsex is seen as an impediment to efficiency. In a clockwork orange,\nits evil is equated with violence, and Alex conditioned to respond\nnegatively to all forms of sex. In Caligari, the institutionalized\nprotagonist fantasizes about the love he never had, underscoring\nhis insanity. In all cases, especially in Brasil , the\ndream, or fantasy, is an expression of the character's suppressed\nurge, and is what motivates his actions, it is his impetus for\nrebellion against the system that denies him his desires.\nIn other dystopic stories, where sex is\nnot outlawed, it has been institutionalized and commodified,\nregimented in such as way as to allow the institutional powers\nto control their subjects' physical urges. Love and committement\nare removed from the equation in an act of dehumanization that\ngoes even further than the aforementioned cases.\n3. Collin\nGardner\n4. Suzanne\nGibson\n\u201cA picture is worth a thousand words\u201d,\nand these images from the films; Brazil, Clockwork Orange and True\nStories are no exception. Customs play a very important role in\nfilm, in the case of these given images; customs are used to demonstrate\nthe demoralizing and oppressive nature of modern society. In all\nthree cases the directors are not interested in capturing reality,\nrather the primary focus is in capturing the moods and the negative\neffects modernity has on society. Hence in all three films normal\nsituation are captured, yet the customs and context distorts reality\nand create an astrosphere that is not \u2018normal\u2019 causing\nthe viewer to question common perceptions.\nIn the movie Brazil, the mother is always shown\ndistinctly oppose to the other characters that are very similar\nto one another. The director uses customs to distinguish the mother\ncharacter, in this image she is wearing a boot as hot, her clothing\nis as distinct as it is unique. As interesting as the outfits are\nthey are not the focus of the movie, the costumes are only a tool\nused to focus the viewer on the character as she is in the being\nand the empty vessel she becomes. In a state were freedom is prohibited\nthe character loses the p erson she was and becomes a soulless replication,\ndevoid of thought and feelings.\nIn the case of Clockwork Orange, the luridly colorful\nsets and costumes distorts the common place to create the bases\nfor a psychological myth, a myth were one questions the inherent\nviolence in humanity, and the nature of free will. The costumes\nare part of the fable, and they lead the viewer away from reality\nand allow them to more freely focus on moral questions that are\nbeing asked.\nAnd lastly in the film True Stories, ordinary images\nare recast to create new shapes, and create a bizarre urban landscape.\nEvery scene seems ordinary, but the ordinary behaves oddly, in\nthis case a fashion show where the models are dressed as building\nmaterials. It is a movie that leads one to question Middle America,\nand suburbia. In all three cases the directors take common scenarios\na twist the everyday to create a distortion of reality, hence allowing\nthe view to look beyond the common and question the perceptions\nthat are being questioned by the directors.\n5. Vera\nGuo\nThe significance to the three frames is that they\nall tell the setting and time of the movie. It helps set up a scenario\nfor the viewers and depict an idea in relation to the present. In\nthe first scene of Brazil , \"Somewhere in the 20th Century\" is\nwritten with the sky as a backdrop. This lets viewers know that it\ncould be anywhere around present times. As the film progresses it\nis increasingly apparent that there is not a frame of reference to\neither time or space. It is impossible to distinguish where things\nare happening. At the end of the film, it is clear that it did not\nmatter what the location and time was because it was all in the characters\nmind. This unidentifiable frame of existence relates to Arnold Toynbee\u2019s\nidea of postmodernism society in which he said postmodernism sees\nsociety as losing its creative energy and living in a safe, satisfactory,\nand timeless present.\nIn Blade Runner the text \" Los Angeles November,\n2019\" appears at the beginning of the film. It lets us know\nexactly where the movie is taking place and the year. It is important\nthat we know the plot to the film is taking place in an urban area\nin the future unlike in Brazil . We can then relate this to our present\nyear Los Angeles and imagine where the city is going to be in another\nthirteen years although the film was made in 1982. It is interesting\nto see that twenty-four years ago filmmakers believed that 2019 seemed\nlike a far enough time away from the present.\nIn True Stories, David Byrne narrates the stories\nsurrounding the lives of characters in a town that is celebrating\ntheir sesquicentennial with a \"Celebration of Specialness.\u201d This\nframe is significant as it depicts the main event in which the film\nrevolves around. It is also the theme of the whole film, this festive\nnature of the town, from the fashion show, talent contest, lip-synching,\nand parade. It is shows the location as a generic suburban town in\nthe present time of when the movie was filmed.\n6. John\nLee\nEach image depicts a prison cell, a place of\ncaptivity, and each leads to or signifies a significant revelation\nin the plot, from which the dystopic natures of the films emerge.\nIn the image from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\nfor example, the distorted walls and its markings reflects the\ndistortion in the plot development, eventually culminating in a\ncomplete and ironic role-reversal for Francis. The manipulation\nof the physical world suggests that the true imprisonment lies\nelsewhere.\nThrough captivity, irony also becomes apparent\nin A Clockwork Orange. A single shot of Alex\u2019s cell\nundermines the contrition he had expressed earlier, but also demonstrates\na sense of freedom (as he is able to personalize his space). This\nis later contradicted by the sterility of his room at the clinic,\nand foreshadows his subsequent loss of freedom. Kubrick suggests\nthat even prison is preferable to the solution proposed by the\ngovernor, for at least prison preserves a sense of humanity and\nindividuality. The unobjectionable portrayal of the prison cell\nemphasizes the emancipation of mental capabilities, and implies\nthat dystopia arises from the opposite condition.\nFinally, when Sam is captured towards the end\nof Brazil, the cell itself encapsulates his absolute isolation\n- from society, from \u2018the girl\u2019 - and the tragic futility\nof his attempt to escape the bureaucratic and autonomous system\nin which he lives. Brazil accentuates the significance\nof mental faculties, an underlying notion in the other films; for\nSam Lowry, it is a means to escape the rigidity of his social structure\nand even imprisonment. However, by pursuing and ultimately realizing\nhis dreams, Sam is left with neither dreams nor reality, but a\nconfusing and dystopic combination of the two. Indeed, only when\nthe physical world is removed from Sam - through imprisonment -\ncan he dream again. The end of the film shows a tragic heroism\nin Sam; despite his captivity, he lives vicariou sly through his\ndreams.\nTherefore, the scenes of captivity establish a\nCartesian idea that thinking defines existence, and a contrast\nor irony with freedom of the mind that underlines the importance\nof the imagination.\n7. Nu-Ri\nLee\nThe images give were each taken from a scene of\ndining or drinking from the films: Brazil , Clockwork Orange and\nTrue Stories. The food/or drinking scenes in a film seem to be one\nof the basic elements that give a certain credibility to its mood\nand its setting. Because eating or drinking is a necessary part of\nlife, in fact, an everyday part of life, when we see the condition\nof the characters everyday life, we then relate more to their setting\nor era.\nIn Brazil , the scene at the restaurant when the\ndishes/numbers ordered finally came to the table, all the different\ncuisine look like balls of goo, yet the characters seem to think\nthat was alright because that is part of their futuristic life. It\nwas quite upsetting to look at since the blobs of goo is suppose\nto represent the cuisine in the photo propped in the middle of the\ndish. This shock effect gives reality to Brazil \u2019s condition\nof the future where one of its themes is about technology gone wrong.\nIn Clockwork Orange, the scene of image is set at\nthe Korova milk bar, where Alex\u2019s gang drinks the drugged milk\nand hangs out. The milk comes out of an erotic female figure sculptural\ndispenser with sexual connotations. The scenes before the bar where\nthe gangs routine violence portrayed, is more believable now that\nwe see where they hang out. This bar scene is important to the element\nof crating dystopia in the film because the d\u00e9cor and the\nsetting is very different than the world outside of that bar. The\nerotic and sexually positioned plastic sculptures used as furniture,\nand the shiny white d\u00e9cor and neon lights portray a sense\nof surrealistic, dream-like quality to that scene.\nIn True Stories, the scene in the image is where\nDavid Byrne is dining with the mayor\u2019s family. The seating\narrangement and the dinner table etiquette is quite old world. It\ntells us the conservativeness of that small suburban Texan town.\nThe dinner table and its food becomes representational of how the\nsuburban town works when the dad begin to fickle with and around\nthe food explaining to Byrne, the future of their town. This film\nis set as a documentary/\u2019mock-umentary\u2019 about the \u201cCelebration\nof Specialness\u201d in that suburban town and it is clear that\nfrom this scene that there is nothing special about this town, but\nits people. They seem to have been brain-washed to think that where\nthey live and work is the next revolution in the history of living.\nUnlike the other two films, the dining scene is quite familiar to\nus, the family gathered together with guest, thus formal utensils\nand china; thus it gives a sense that this town is probably really\nlike that, it gives a mood that all suburban may be that way too.\n8. Michael\nLin\nThe images above show a series of contraptions\nworn on or relating to the head. These contraptions restrain or\nactivate by way of stimuli or force. The aim of these devices as\na restraining or securing device is to produce a wanted result\nforcibly; as such two parties can be identified in the use of these\ndevices, the subject and the controller, or the powers that be.\nThe bureaucratic forces in Brazil operate for\nefficiency. When Sam Lowry\u2019s dream world meets his actual\nworld via the woman of his dreams, his work and life starts to\nfall apart. In the end, his questioning of the system which he\nhimself is part of like a cog in a machine results in incomplete\npaperwork and inefficiency for the system. His detainment eventually\nleads to him being in the subject\u2019s seat. The Information\nRetrieval system is a euphemistic name for torture. This retrieval\nprocess treats the civilians as commodities or information storehouses.\nPeople are dehumanized in such a way that they become expendable\nin order to serve the system in an efficient way. Sam is in this\nvery situation where the system which he serves turns on him and\neven charges him for his own torture. The Retrieval Chair can be\nseen as a physical manifestation of the system\u2019s power, that\notherwise invisible eye that is watching and the invisible hand\nthat has a grasp on all the civilians and workers of this world.\nThe chair is the ultimate process of efficiency, where life is\nseen to have lesser value than information and the process itself\nis even given a monetary value.\nWhen Alex is captured in A Clockwork Orange, he\nis put through a process of brainwashing known as the Ludovico\ntechnique. Alex is strapped in and given a drug that induces nauseating\npains while forced to watch extreme violent images. This process\nis meant to psychologically alter his animal impulses that lead\nto violence. The contraption used forcibly holds Alex\u2019s eyes\nwide open in a rather graphic portrayal in the film. In this way,\nthe authorities of society have made an assault on Alex that is\nmore deeply affecti ng than any physical assault he had committed\nprior. The process and the device used to manifest it forcefully\nsupplant a behaviour that relates to Alex\u2019s brain, his heart,\nand his instincts and can be seen as a psychological assault. The\naftermath of this device turns Alex into a victim of violence not\nunlike his own victims at the beginning of the film.\nIn Metropolis 1927, the mad scientist Rotwang\ndevoted himself to creating a robot version of the revolutionary\nMaria in order to stir up the workers. He creates a device that\ngives the robot flesh and life. In this case, the device is used\nto generate the will of a controller into vessel, an artificial\nbeing. Again, it is a device that aims to control.\nThe restraining contraptions in all these films\ndemonstrate how the powers that be attempt to bend its subjects\nto their will, to generate a desired result forcibly. The agendas\nbehind and devices and the very devices themselves help to generate\ndystopia and fear in the film with their menacing physical presence.\n9. Veronica\nLorenzo-Luaces Pico\nI believe these three images are connected by\nthe overarching themes of pain and pleasure in the movies.\nPeople in general watch movies because they feel\nsome kind of pleasure in doing so. I was given three images where\nsome or all of the characters were being subjected to different\nkinds of torture. In today\u2019s society we have developed a\ntolerance for violence in films, a kind of unresponsiveness to\nphysical pain against others. We feel enjoyment watching horrid\nimages.\nThe first image I was given is from Brazil. Here\nthe mother is being subjected to some kind of face-lift. Her face\nis being stretched to the maximum in order to make her younger,\nand more beautiful. Here the character does not seem to be feeling\nany kind of pain. She is able to follow up a normal conversation,\nlike nothing is happening. It may be that she is able to control\nthis pain in her mind knowing that it will be rewarded by the immense\npleasure of beauty.\nThe second image comes from the movie Clockwork\nOrange. Here Alex is severely hitting his best friend, and the\nscene ends when he throws him in the water. Up to this point Alex\nhad only been mistreating strangers, but no he starts being violent\nwith his best friends too. The pain that comes from his violence\ngives him pleasure.\nThe third image shows an eye being cut by a knife.\nIt is a horrible image that fascinates us at the same time. The\npain this person must be going through troubles and pleasures us.\nThis inverse relationship between opposites can be seen as the\nidea of the sublime.\nThe idea of the sublime is presented as the opposite\nof the beautiful. The sublime is an emotion founded on some variation\nof the feeling of pain or terror, which, when modified by expectation\nand surprise, causes in the mind what is described as astonishment,\na feeling that operates both at the level of the mind and the body.\nIt can be exemplified \u201cas producing an unnatural tension\nand certain violent emotions of the nerves\u201d (Burke).\n10. Arjun\nMani\nThese three pictures capture the bittersweet\nresolutions of the films with iconographic conditions that would\nnormally cater to a happy ending, but are used here to emphasize\nthe persistence of dystopia through contrast. It is often difficult\nto see a movie end in gloom, we naturally tend to expect a good\nturnout no matter the subject matter. Dystopic themes, however,\nneed to carry through to the credits in order for them to leave\nwith audience, and in order for the intentions of the film to be\nfully realized.\nIn Brazil, Sam Lowry is seemingly freed\nfrom the nightmare of his crumbling reality, but forever imprisoned\nin an acid-trip of a daydream. Sam\u2019s degenerating dream at\nfirst stirs up hope then slyly steals it away as the viewer discovers\nthat the absurdities of the situation are increasingly abnormal\neven for Terry Gilliam\u2019s direction. In the final disillusionment,\nwe see an unresponsive Sam lost in a fantasy to the tune of Brazil,\nwhile the dystopic world around him has not changed. He has \u201cescaped\u201d this\nworld, but only on its terms. Dystopia remains a permanent reality\nand leaves with the audience as a bitter taste in their mouths.\nTrue Stories ends on the same note it\nstarted on. The happy ending for Louis is more comedic than fairy-tailish, and\nthe general absurdity of Virgil and its citizens is topped off\nwith a \u201cbed-in\u201d wedding. Like Brazil, the\nresolution of the film does not bring any hope for improvement\nof society, and the viewer is left with unresolved sentiments as\nto what has been achieved. Essentially, nothing has been achieved,\nand that captures the dystopic themes of stagnation and idleness\nwithin society.\nBlade Runner \u2019s \u201cHollywood\nending\u201d, while not Ridley Scott\u2019s intention, just barely\nmanages to maintain the dystopic qualities of the film. While Deckard\nand Rachael drive into the scenic landscape, (stock footage from\nKubrick\u2019s The Shining), we are reminded by the voiceover\nof the fleetingne ss of this happiness, and the general uncertainties\nof life. The true dystopic themes, however, are abruptly silenced,\nand only partially resurface as memories due to the stark contrast.\nInterestingly enough, Brazil\u2019s ending also suffered\na studio imposed edit for syndicated TV release known as the \u201cLove\nconquers all/TV edit\u201d.\n11. Darcy\nMcNinch\nIn the film Brazil technology seems to be taking\nover the world, it is very claustrophobic and frightening. This\nis also a common element in the films Blade Runner and Osamu Tezuka\u2019s\nMetropolis, the service infrastructure appears to be taking over\nwhat it is actually serving. In Brazil there are pipes and ducts\nand wires running everywhere, through public spaces, up through\nthe floors, outside, inside\u2026 everywhere. The characters\nin the film, especially Sam Lowry seems to be constantly plagued\nby them and their maintenance. In both Brazil and Blade Runner\nit appears there is no natural landscape left, both are filled\nwith television screens watching the inhabitants every move. The\ncities are over-crowded, dark and polluted. In Metropolis the upper\nlevels of the city are bright and cheerful, yet still no image\nof a natural landscape, and the lower levels are just like those\nin the other two films: over-crowded and full of rubbish; The cities\nin these films are truly dystopic nightmarish places.\nOne gets the sense that there is very little freedom\nin these places, that the people are constantly under surveillance\nand one wrong move will land them in trouble. Not only is this\nfelt, but also fully demonstrated in all three, the main characters\ntry to help someone in trouble and become ostracized because of\nit.\nWhile watching these films, most noticeably a\nsense confinement and desperation is created. The audience is firmly\nconnected to Sam and his every blunder; everything within the film\nfeels contrived and controlling and to this sense of claustrophobia,\nthere exists monotony in most of the settings, and a lack of emotion\nor immediacy in any of the characters apart from the hero and heroine.\nThe technology in these films is overpowering\nand domineering, it creates a sense of control over the characters\nwithin the film as well as the audience witnessing it; the services\nare unmanageably out of control and a sense of being watched is\nprevalent. These films point out societies love-hate relationship\nwith modern devices how we think we control them and they serve\nus but eventually we find ourselves at their mercy.\n12. Ben\nNielson\nThe common theme between the photos is more than\nviolence; violence in and of itself does not promote a sense of\ndystopia. These four films take their dystopic effect from the\nuse of violence to disrupt the viewer\u2019s sense of security \u2013 to\nintroduce violence into situations the viewer assumes are secure.\nThe first two images violate the sense that the\nhome is a fortress. Alex and his friends invaded the security of\nthe writer\u2019s home using a ploy that any sympathetic person\ncould have been taken in by \u2013 the viewer is left with the\nunsettling impression that being a decent human being leaves the\nhome completely open to random and reasonless violence. Similarly,\nRoy gains entry into Dr.Tyrell\u2019s home using one of Tyrell\u2019s\nfriends as a pre-text. Where the violence in clockwork orange is\nfrightening through its randomness \u2013 blade runner frightens\nthrough its persistence. Tyrell is behind a technologically bolstered\nset of security measures, but by allowing access to a friend he\nalso let the persistent seekers of revenge waltz in.\nThe next image produces its unsettling effect\nthrough the instability of power relationships. The film Black\nCat takes place in Dr. V. Werdegast\u2019s home, and he is in\ncontrol through the film, toying with the protagonists. When tables\nare turned and the Doctor is trussed up for skinning \u2013 we\nare shown that no matter our confidence in our control of the situation,\nchance and the machinations of others can lead to sudden loss of\npower, leaving us at the mercy of the often violent world.\nThe final image shows Sam Lowry\u2019s horrified\nreaction to a \u2018terrorist\u2019 bombing in the film Brazil\n. The dystopic quality comes from, once again, the intrusion of\nviolence into a secure situation. The victims of the bombing weren\u2019t\nspecifically evil, hadn\u2019t done anything specific to attract\nthe violence they experienced, they simply happened to be in the\nwrong public place at the wrong time.\nThese images show how the four films in question\nuse violence to violate our sense of security, to show us that\na reasonable concern for security and being what is considered\na \u2018good person\u2019 is no defense from a world filled with\nrandomly directed, persistent and manipulative violence.\n13. Uros\nNovakovic\nThe three images from the films Brazil, Clockwork\nOrange and Blade Runner, present the shots in which\neyes, trough which we recognize people\u2019s identity, are\nindicative of the characters\u2019 humanness or lack of it.\nEyes are intrinsically tied to a recognition of one\u2019s  an\nidentity and an insight into one\u2019s true nature.\nFirst image (Brazil): This image\nrepresents \u2018the gaze of authority\u2019. Crucially, the\neyeless faces in the background define the character of the image.\nThey are the power vested in the authority of the gaze. The eyes,\nin this context, reveal nothing of the actual personality. It is\nunclear whether the person is sympathetic or not. They merely reflect\nthe authority.\nSecond image (Clockwork Orange): The\nsecond image represents the state of psychological terror, reminiscent\nof Munch\u2019s Scream. This is equally a moment of a\nloss of humanity. It is a critical moment in the film, when the\nrelatively normal socio-political condition disintegrates. The \u2018author\nof subversive literature\u2019, who up to this point, was a definite\nforce of \u2018good\u2019, is turned into an de-humanized vengeful\ncreature.\nThird Image (Blade Runner): The\nthird image is the only moment in the film, when the audience is\nconfronted with the process of replikant production. The\nartificiality and non-humanness, which could have been questioned\nby the viewer, is emphasized and directly showcased, in presenting\nthe process of eye production.\n14. Michael\nTaylor\nWhen looking at the recurring theme of authoritarian\ngovernance over the films Brazil, Clockwork Orange, and Bladerunner,\nwe see how there is potential for the ability of mankind to oppress\nand through corruption, power, or ignorance and maintain the\nability to enact restrictive policies on the emotional and physical\nnatures of his fellow man. In Brazil we see the monotonous repetitive\nsoldier who\u2019s only will in the movie is to shoot the infiltrator\nwithout question. The lack of interrogation and idea of shoot\nfirst ask questions later is purely a tactic used by the ignorant\nin society when the ability to oppress supersedes the moral and\nethical qualities of the individual. As the soldiers of Brazil\nact not even as police officers but more like gun carrying henchmen,\nand carry out there tasks unabated by the goings on of the interior\nof the building, simply obeying the orders carried out by the\nchief without interruption. Within A clockwork orange there becomes\na reversal of fortune in that when Alex and his past friends had\noriginally been the ethically incorrect individuals who act out\nagainst the power which controls society through the general\npolicing of they city, with Alex as there leader, it is now those\nsame counterparts who have basically carried over to the other\nside in favor of perhaps that same power executed through corruption\nwithout the fear of retribution or consequence, as with the overarching\nideal of police, whose general ideals are to include protection\nof the people, Dim has used this same power to ensure that Alex\nfeels their vengeance for that same power he used over them previous.\nIn bladerunner, we see the captain, a more generally\njaded individual, who has become lost in a world of where the idea\nof the individual within society has now been pushed so that it\nbecomes more and more difficult to differentiate between human\nand machine. His ultimate goal within the movie seems to act within\nthe same oppressive bounds as the others, and without questioning\nthe motives of the powers that be, he simply gives orders without\ntrue reason to search out and execute any rebellious individuals\nin effect himself becoming the ignorant power machine of the dystopic\nage held within bladerunner.\n15. Holly\nYoung\nExtrapolated Question: Describe the role that\ncamera angles play in contributing to the atmosphere of a film,\nwith emphasis on the ability of the low-angled shot to create an\nenvironment of fear and dystopia.\nCamera angles are critical elements involved in\nthe conception and execution of a film project. The relationship\nbetween the camera and the subject being filmed provides emotional\ninformation to the viewers, influencing and guiding their judgment\nof the object or character being shot. The more severe the angle,\nthe more symbolically-loaded the shot. When used effectively, camera\nangles can evoke feelings of fear, sympathy or suspense, and incite\nany number of emotions. They draw an audience in to the action of\na movie, personalizing the experience, keeping their attention and\nmaking them feel involved as the plot develops. In fact, film angles\nare so integral to filmmaking that Stanley Kubrick personally shoots\nall of the detailed camera work for his films himself.\nThese two screen shots from Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u2018A\nClockwork Orange\u2019 and Terry Gilliam\u2019s \u2018 Brazil \u2019 are\nexamples of a specific type of camera angle. Both shots are taken\nclose to the floor of their respective sets, and are angled sharply\nup toward subjects about to deliver a killing blow (one to a fly\nusing a stack of papers, and the other to a woman using a giant penis\nsculpture). The result is disorienting and threatening: typical attributes\nof a low-angled shot.\nThe most common camera angle is positioned at eye\nlevel. It serves as a fairly neutral shot, situated as if  it were\na person actually observing the scene. The camera is typically placed\nabout five to six feet above floor and on a level of focus with the\nheads of the actors. Both \u2018Brazil\u2019 and \u2018A Clockwork\nOrange\u2019 make use of this shot for much of their stories; however,\nit is the contrast of this typical shot against the more extreme\nangles that give the latter their unusual quality, making them feel\nout of place in comparison and charging them with emotion. Low angled\nshots, like those depicted above, increase height, elongating the\nsurroundings, and also making any motion in the shot seem faster.\nThe viewer feels small and powerless within the action of the scene.\nLow angles inspire confusion in the audience, as the background is\noften just a view of the sky or ceiling, and such lack of detail\nabout setting disorients onlookers. Also, the added height to the\ncamera\u2019s subject can inspire fear in vieiwers, who are psychologically\ndominated by the individual (or object) on the screen. In contrast,\nthe high angled shot can be used to the opposite effect: making the\nsubject of the shot feel smaller and less daunting. However, this\ntype of shot can be manipulated for use in dystopic filmmaking as\nit can also be used to show a character that the audience identifies\nwith getting \u2018swallowed\u2019 by a frightening setting and\nto project a sense of the helplessness of that character in his current\nsituation.\n16. Michael\nMorgan\nDiscuss the significance of the use of numbers\nand letters as identification of characters in Brazil, A Clockwork\nOrange, and Metropolis (Anime 2001).\nAn analysis of the use of index numbers in the films \u201cBrazil\u201d, \u201cA\nClockwork Orange\u201d, and \u201cMetropolis (Anime 2001)\u201d,\nreveal how index numbers are used in each case to help portray a\ncharacter\u2019s role in their respective societies in each of the\nfilms.\nIn Brazil, Lowry is given the number DZ-015 when\nhe becomes part of the Information Retrieval Agency. When Lowry is\ngiven this label it is symbolic of not only his role within the company,\nbut within society as well. In the eyes of society, he is no longer\nLowry, he is DZ-015, an insignificant office worker crammed into\na windowless half-office, who is part of a vast network of insignificant\noffice workers also crammed into half-offices. Another thing to consider\nis that every time DZ-015 attempts to find love and happiness he\nis thwarted by social institutions, such as the Information Retrieval\nAgency. In summary, turning Lowry into DZ-015 entails a removal of\npersonal choice and the subsequent suppression of his individuality,\nleaving just a mere quantitatively defined entity serving the needs\nof a society that took personal choice away from him.\nA similar situation arises in \u201cA Clockwork\nOrange\u201d, when the main character Alex enters into the prison\nsystem. After Alex is found guilty of murder and passes through the\nprison gates he stops being Alex the individual and instead becomes\nprisoner 655 321. Once Alex is prisoner 655321 his personal freedom\nis removed and in turn his individuality is suppressed as well. In\nAlex\u2019s case, society is represented by the prison system and\ngovernment that treats him like a lab rat by testing all sort of\nnonsensical methods of rehabilitation on him.\nFinally, the robot, Pero, in \u201cMetropolis 2001\u201d,\nexperiences a similar situation that occurs to Lowry and Alex in \u201cBrazil\u201d and \u201cA\nClockwork Orange\u201d. When Pero is assigned to help Shunsaku Ban\nhe is treated as a mere robot slave, like all robots in Metropolis.\nAs a slave, he has no personal choice which is reflected in both\nhis original name, D-RP-DM\u2014C, and Pero, the name Ban gives\nhim that was originally the name of a dog he once owned.\nTaken together, the use of letters and numbers as\npersonal identification in each of these films helps to portray characters\nthat are in a certain sense enslaved by the societies they live in\nand further indicate how their individuality is suppressed when their\npersonal choice is taken away.\n17. Ashley\nSnell\nBrazil \u2013 Restaurant Scene | Blade\nRunner \u2013 Models | True Stories \u2013 the Suburbs\nAll three set up a dystopic environment for the\nfilms in different ways. In Brazil, it is a life-size built scene\nto look \u2018modern\u2019. In Blade Runner, they use models\nto represent the \u2018modern\u2019 city, which has a similar\nlook to the interiors of Brazil. In True Stories, it is a different\nlook at to what \u2018modern\u2019 is, real living today. The\nempty lot leaves it up to the imagination but really it is a trick\nand you will picture a house like all the others. Looking at each\nimage, you would not be able to tell its location. If Blade Runner\nand True Stories did not tell you the locations, they could be\nset anywhere. There is a sense of timelessness. Brazil actually\nbeing timeless but the other two could easily be the same even\nwith the two different types of \u2018modern\u2019.\nThe images of these environments also reflect what\nis happening in the film. The busy, bustling set in Brazil representing\nthe chaos of the people and all the act ion-taking place. Blade\nRunner also has chaos and business in the lower level of the city,\nwhich these models were constructed for. Chaos is one of the ingredients\nfor a dystopic environment. In True Stories, this bland normal\nimage is just like the people in the story, ordinary. This may\nnot be bustling but there is something unnerving about the \u2018perfect\u2019 neighbourhood.\nThe ductwork in Brazil symbolizes the umbilical\nrelationship of the people to the centralized government and the\nloss of aesthetics in our cities (http://www.trond.com/brazil/b_faq12.html).\nNot only is it a connection of the people to the government, it\nrepresents the social classes. As discussed in the other films\nwhere the classes are vertically separated, this one is represented\ndifferently. The more ductwork visible in the home or office proved\nto be of a lower class. The buildings in Blade Runner and the suburbs\nin True Stories are also in the lower to middle class ranges.\nThe idea of the loss of aesthetics in our cities\ncan be seen through all the images. Ductwork is not that pleasing\nto the eye and therefore is normally covered up. In Blade Runner,\nthese buildings are more in the slums. In True Stories, this typical\nsuburb found everywhere, is not aesthetically nice to most architects\nbut is loved by most middle class person. Bringing me to the next\npoint, the ductwork also can represent a loss of values. It proves\nthe people to have more of a materialistic value over spiritual.\nLiving in the suburbs, alludes to a certain material value of the\nowner. To own a house with a big garden and little white fence\nis a dream. It shows their worth to their friends and neighbours.\nTerry Gilliam's Brazil\nhttp://www.trond.com/brazil/b_faq12.html\n18. Ivy\nHo\nThe most apparent similarities of the three images\nare the use of backlighting and shadows. This technique has been\nvery prominent in the film selection of this class. The elongated\nand distorted shapes of shadows create mystery. In the absence\nof visual details, the audience is left with abstract shapes of\nshadows and their movements in the dim space. Thus, the imagination\nkicks in, evoking anticipation and perhaps fears.\nThe other element that these three images demonstrate\nis the visual composition of the frame and the scene using the\ntechnique of backlighting and shadows. In both the Black Cat and\nClockwork Orange, one can note the scale of the characters\u2019 shadows\ncompared to the space of the frame. The characters overwhelm the\nframe with their huge shadows, making them seem more menacing and\npowerful. However, Sam Lowry in Brazil seems small and insignificant\nwhen he first steps into the Lobby of the Department of Information.\nThe building is huge, voluminous and vast. Sam is completely overpowered\nby his environment. Thus, beyond the immediate effect that tonality\nhas on the audience, the scale of shadows also convey the tension\nbetween the characters and the space around them. Furthermore,\nthis visual relationship between characters and their environments\nreveals the state of mind of the characters themselves. The way\nthat the characters feel directly affects the way in which they\noccupy their environment. In Brazil , Sam is a small, law-abiding\nman who is more fearful than he is ambitious. Thus, as he enters\ninto this new work environment where he has been promoted, he is\ntimid. While in Clockwork Orange, Alex and his droogs are bold.\nThey are there to take over the bridge. The image from the Black\nCat is slightly different. It is an image that reveals the fear\nof the doctor who is not in the scene. The sly entrance of the\nblack cat reveals the doctor\u2019s fear of it. The degree of\nelongation in the shadow of the cat\u2019s legs may be in direct\nproportion to the fear of the doctor. Thus, what is on screen reveals\nthe state of mind of a character that is off screen.\n19. Jonah\nHumphrey\nThe images shown from the films Brazil , A Clockwork\nOrange , and True Stories , respectively, depict the urban (or\nsuburban) environments of the grim, hard-surfaced fictional cities\nin which these films take place. The first image is a shot from\nabove Sam\u2019s apartment, in Terry Gilliam\u2019s Brazil .\nStrangely, it appears that this is Sam\u2019s balcony, and yet,\nit seems that it is the only entrance into the building, suggesting\nthe unforgiving urban surroundings found in this mythical city\nextend vertically through all floors of these brutalist neo-classical\ntowers. Though this particular shot utilizes a stage set, parts\nof Sam\u2019s apartment building were shot on location in France\n, at the Marne La Vallee\u2014a huge apartment complex designed\nby Ricardo Bofil, ironically, now the site of EuroDisney. Continuing\nthe theme of brutalist, concrete architecture, we see the second\nimage of the Ludovico Medical Centre in A Clockwork Orange , which\nin reality is Brunel College , Middlesex, Uxbridge\u2014a site\nthat demonstrates the hard-edged, prison-like nature of the not-so-distant\nfuture Kubrick brings to the viewer. Lastly, we see a ty pical North\nAmerican suburban strip-mall, portrayed jokingly as something \u201cspecial\u201d in\nDavid Byrne\u2019s True Stories , featuring the ironically named\nstore \u201cThe Home Front\u201d, suggesting a Home Depot type\nof large home renovations/finishing store, while presenting it\u2019s\nown incredibly bland fa\u00e7ade.\nThe most striking feature of these three urban\nenvironments that are depicted in these films, is the lack of any\nsoft edges, and more specifically, a lack of life\u2014plant,\nanimal, or even human. Perhaps these represent a parody of the\nmodernist architectural visions, so often depicted in pristine\nrenderings. We find, here, these idyllic realms realized, but they\nhave become worlds that in fact imprison us spatially, offering\nlaughable examples of ornamentation, and thus represent the commoditized\nand codified, aesthetically benign realities we can find in our\nown world. These extreme versions of the banal urban environments\nof today\u2019s cities, give us a glimpse of their becoming the\nempty, dystopic public environments, that, in fact, no one wishes\nto inhabit.\nUltimately, these films criticize the potentially\ndomineering and unforgiving nature much of architecture may take\non, when built under a regime of control, or in a city or district\nthat isolates itself from its context, and indeed the rest of the\nworld. The first and last images more specifically relate to the\ninherent problems with architecturally stripped down, repeatable\nor even identical developments, that make no reference to their\nlocation, their surrounding context, or even their inhabitants,\nother than perhaps the overly generalized political organization\nthat imposes a wash of absurd consistency on its population, which\nis the creator of the ideology of consistency that gives form to\nthe architecture of these films. Differing only in its more specialized,\nand arguably, more interesting architecture, the Ludovico Medical\nCentre\u2019s building is the paramount example of government\nmaintaining control in society. This structure demonstrates the\nsituation, wherein, the imprisoning nature of the governments of\nthe other two films (as with the methods of a sweeping bureaucracy,\nor an overriding consistency), is exchanged for the targeting of\nindividuals who attempt to step outside the norms society upholds,\nsuch that they are ultimately controlled even more severely than\nany other members of society.\nWith the Ludovico technique itself, the means\nof control in A Clockwork Orange we find a striking similarity\nto the final torturous scenes of Sam Lowry at the end of Brazil\n. In the latter case, however, Sam finds his only means of alleged\nescape from the dreary, controlled environment of the \u2018real\nworld\u2019 in the film, is to drift into his own dream world,\nwhere he can still imagine realms of lush green landscapes and\ngently moving clouds\u2014elements that seem totally absent in\nthe extreme urban environment of Brazil . This escapist end to\nthe film may show the ultimate problem of these dystopic future\nworlds, for, as when these severe urban environments become so\nunlivable as to force one to live completely inwardly, one becomes\nan even greater prisoner, held captive by their own unrealizable\ndreams.\n20. Aleks\nKolbas\nUse of a car to convey fear and dystopia\nin \u2018Clockwork Orange \u2019, \u2018 Brazil \u2019 and \u2018True\nStories\u2019\nIn old western movies, it was always known which\ncowboy was the \u2018powerhouse\u2019 of them all, of course,\nthe one with the best looking horse. As the technology transformed\na horse to horsepower, the ideology of having a good ride in movies\ndid not lose its cache. There is something peculiar in analyzing\nthe main characters\u2019 means of transportation; it is bound\nto be of utmost importance exuding wealth and coolness. Directly\ntied to a main character, a hot car was a must. It inevitably showed\na true colour of a character, rather portrayed a villain or a hero.\nSo it too, in these three feature movies, a car\nconveys the nature of their main characters as well as valiantly\nemphasizing the thematic ideas behind them. We see Alex and his\ngang in \u2018Clockwork Orange\u2019 racing down the city streets\nwith great speed in a hot convertible, screaming, yelling and causing\nriot. The shot was taken from a moving car in front of them making\nthem appear as though they are chasing someone, which alluded to\ntheir cruel intentions and bad behaviour. A car makes a clear statement\nof their nature in the movie. In \u2018True Stories\u2019, the\nred Cadillac convertible played an important part is demonstrating\nwealth. Cadillac was at a time an icon of American high standard\ntransportation system, and it was seen as a precedent for treatment\nof respect. This ideology behind a car really didn\u2019t change\nmuch and it still remains a fact today. Have you seen the new Cadillac\nCTS? Nonetheless, \u2018True Stories\u2019 came at the time when\nAmerican Dream came to its peak, in desperation to be achieved\nby the general public, so to speak. It was a fad to own a car,\nown a bungalow or a nice suburban home, and travel. The highwa y,\nlong roads, big shopping malls, is the aid for serving such desires\nof a man. It made one happy having everything within his reach.\nThis was successfully illustrated in this movie, so a Cadillac\nis just that, a tool that made one noticed. A car in \u2018 Brazil \u2019 showed\na different kind of fad. This futuristic, convenient, one man ship\nwas owned only by elite, it was for ones that worked for government,\ndepartment of identity retrieval, to be more precise. It almost\nreminded me of smart car of today, a fad that brings one to fear\nseeing it next to 20 ton eighteen-wheeler on an eight lane highway.\nA car does say something about its owner, and not just in movies\nbut in real life. It shows our omnipotence, our desire to be noticed\nand respected; it\u2019s our way of expressing. Movies do that\nwell, but unfortunately some of its coolness brings violence to\nour streets.\n21. Tavis\nMcAuley\nEach of the three images demonstrates a version\nof how the guardian figure in society has evolved to become the\ndominant force of progress and innovation. This is compared with\nthe current model where commerce operates to encourage innovation\nwithin the constraints established by the guardian operating in\nthe best interest of society. In the film Brazil, It would\nappear that private enterprise has been replaced with state run\ndepartments that manage all aspects of day-to-day life, including\nmaintenance of mechanical systems, services related to funerals,\nand ironically plastic surgery.\nJane Jacobs in her book Systems of Survival explains\nthe roll of both the Guardian and commerce (commercial).\nIn her book Systems of Survival, Jane Jacobs\nproposes that society can be viewed as encompassing two moral\nsyndromes, the \u201cguardian\u201d and the \u201ccommercial.\u201d Jacobs\nargues that the guardian system, or governance, arose in territorial\nand hunting societies, cultures that guarded their boundaries,\nwere suspicious of outsiders, and were deeply protective of their\npossessions. The guardian system is conservative and hierarchical,\nadheres to tradition, values loyalty, and shuns trading and inventiveness.\nThe commercial system, on the other hand, is based on trading,\nand functions well when it is open, trusting of outsiders, innovative,\npositive and forward thinking. It values collaboration, contracts,\ninitiative, and optimism.\nJacobs goes on to say that any combination of these\ntwo moral positions can lead to a \u201cDisastrous Hybrid\u201d where\nthe two systems overlap and have the potential to base decisions\non the opposite bias.\nThe other common thread highlighted in each of\nthe images is the place of media in society. The western ideal\nof having an independent media that maintains transparency of the\nstate has now become the mouthpiece of the government in each of\nthe cited films. In the Caligari image, Dr. Caligari is captured\nwhile standing in front of projected words on the landscape. In\nClockwork Orange, the image of the newspaper headline identifies\nthe government as contributing to the poor science around the \u201cCrime\nCure\u201d procedure. This is especially true in the case of Brazil, where\nthe media now operates to continue the self-fulfilling cycle that\nensures that each department has a steady flow of paperwork and\nbureaucracy to digest. The slogans in the two posters in the background\nof the Brazil image capture this ideal, \u201cDon\u2019t suspect\na friend, report him\u201d and Trust in haste, regret at leisure\u201d\nAll of these themes contribute to the larger dystopic\nforecast of the future of life on the planet.\nback\nto arch and film fall 2006",

Brazil's satire of technocracy, bureaucracy, hyper-surveillance, corporate statism, and state capitalism is reminiscent of George Orwell's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, and it has been called \"Kafkaesque\" as well as absurdist.\nDespite its title, the film is not about the country Brazil nor does it take place there; it is named after the recurrent theme song, Ary Barroso's \"Aquarela do Brasil\", known simply as \"Brazil\" to British audiences, as performed by Geoff Muldaur.\nThough a success in Europe, the film was unsuccessful in its initial North American release. It has since become a cult film. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted Brazil the 54th greatest British film of all time. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for Time Out magazine saw it ranked the 24th best British film ever.\nAs always, ticket holders are privy to some insane drink deals!\nTHE FILM STARTS AT 8PM PLEASE ARRIVE EARLY SO YOU CAN GET A DRINK BEFORE WE PRESS PLAY\nAt Kelham Film Club and Alder Bar we try our best to be as accessible as possible to all our patrons.

This cautionary tale by Terry Gilliam, one of the great films of the 1980s, has come to be esteemed alongside antitotalitarian works by the likes of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and Kurt Vonnegut Jr. And in terms of set design, cinematography, music, and effects, Brazil is a nonstop dazzler.\nPicture 8/10\nCriterion releases Terry Gilliam\u2019s \u201cFinal Cut\u201d of Brazil on Blu-ray, presenting it in the aspect ratio of 1.78:1 on the first dual-layer disc of this two-disc set. The transfer is presented in 1080p/24hz.\nThis looks to be the same high-definition transfer used for Criterion\u2019s 2006 reissue DVD of the film, which offered a substantial improvement itself over Criterion\u2019s original DVD. Here we get a considerably sharper image delivering the fine details of the film\u2019s elaborate production design far clearer than before. Though the image can come off a bit distorted in places, or soft, because of the stylistic choices of the director, the image is quite crisp throughout with clean edges. Film grain is present with exceptional execution, and the transfer doesn\u2019t seem to present any glaring artifacts that mar the image.\nSome of the effect shots present some obvious dirt and grit but source materials look to be in tremendous shape with very little damage otherwise. In all this is easily the best I\u2019ve yet seen the film on home video over its multiple home video versions, and this is definitely the most film-like presentation I\u2019ve seen.\n![](/img/captures/DDCD9C1A-5401-F2D7-A22B-6E0DC5388077.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/C310BB7E-1673-31D2-23E3-1A4AF18E3C60.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/6010935D-69E0-8554-9885-44AF5FA7A14D.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/1B64C977-BBEF-13C3-1AC5-2AAF4836C2FD.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/DD0892EF-06A0-FE0B-2357-46EBC77F31FB.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/07D669C3-2B08-CDC0-F82A-4319C3670DC1.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/85CE96D8-3937-0775-BC2A-60AC31912E8A.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/CC1708F1-F4A8-786F-8165-2A4B7FCD00E0.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/56C4C222-8219-6FE8-ABBB-E1291F71937F.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/F6DD8F10-997F-07C0-F885-962CB027DB08.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/F8872E03-D74A-9833-0AAC-10792BCFF22D.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/EB3120C5-1D94-4D4D-85B7-4DBD2CA0F4C0.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/C6682C45-0551-5630-2D04-E7B6ACEDFCF4.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/85084F3D-F8FF-5876-0CF1-AA219E57D067.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/67992027-A162-4477-477A-DC75DCE65223.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/8438CEC7-6879-E9DE-A763-7AABE4F6F5A1.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/90D7D3A1-2474-D2AF-6DBF-E3483DA7A9FC.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/2E6B8DB8-6A4C-8A80-3DEF-04C91B8CBCD4.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/61E07B2B-2AFC-CF28-200A-11D19349FD5C.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/08E82840-4704-D599-2BDD-C8CC82BFBCDD.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/DDCD9C1A-5401-F2D7-A22B-6E0DC5388077.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/C310BB7E-1673-31D2-23E3-1A4AF18E3C60.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/6010935D-69E0-8554-9885-44AF5FA7A14D.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/1B64C977-BBEF-13C3-1AC5-2AAF4836C2FD.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/DD0892EF-06A0-FE0B-2357-46EBC77F31FB.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/07D669C3-2B08-CDC0-F82A-4319C3670DC1.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/85CE96D8-3937-0775-BC2A-60AC31912E8A.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/CC1708F1-F4A8-786F-8165-2A4B7FCD00E0.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/56C4C222-8219-6FE8-ABBB-E1291F71937F.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/F6DD8F10-997F-07C0-F885-962CB027DB08.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/F8872E03-D74A-9833-0AAC-10792BCFF22D.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/EB3120C5-1D94-4D4D-85B7-4DBD2CA0F4C0.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/C6682C45-0551-5630-2D04-E7B6ACEDFCF4.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/85084F3D-F8FF-5876-0CF1-AA219E57D067.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/67992027-A162-4477-477A-DC75DCE65223.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/8438CEC7-6879-E9DE-A763-7AABE4F6F5A1.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/90D7D3A1-2474-D2AF-6DBF-E3483DA7A9FC.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/2E6B8DB8-6A4C-8A80-3DEF-04C91B8CBCD4.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/61E07B2B-2AFC-CF28-200A-11D19349FD5C.jpg)\n![](/img/captures/08E82840-4704-D599-2BDD-C8CC82BFBCDD.jpg)\nAudio 7/10\nThe disc comes with 2.0 DTS-HD MA surround track. Michael Kamen\u2019s incredible score sounds vivid and alive, spreading between the speakers wonderfully. There\u2019s some fantastic range and depth to it, with stunning clarity. It\u2019s the best I\u2019ve yet heard the score.\nUnfortunately the rest of the track comes off a bit flat with only some minor depth. Dialogue can be a bit muddled at times and effects, which do make their way to the rear speakers during the more action-packed sequences, can also have a hollow sound to them. For the most part dialogue is easy to hear but there are times where its overwhelmed by other factors.\nThe track has always had these problems, though, so it\u2019s more than likely inherent in the source materials. As it is it\u2019s fine enough but shows its age somewhat.\nExtras 9/10\nProbably one of Criterion\u2019s most famous releases on Laserdisc all of the content w as ported over to the original 3-disc DVD edition they released, and their 2006 3-disc reissue. Most of that content has been ported over to this 2-disc Blu-ray but Criterion, as they\u2019ve been doing a lot recently, have left out some text material and galleries.\nThe first disc's extra is an audio commentary by Terry Gilliam recorded for the original Laserdisc edition in 1996. The director, wired up as usual, talks in great detail about his development of the film from story to screen, covering all of the ideas he had including what ultimately didn\u2019t make it. He recalls various anecdotes about the production, how he was able to get certain actors into the film (specifically De Niro) and talks about how the film has grown with audiences. He talks a little about the troubles that came up surrounding its American release but he seems to save most of that for the documentary that is included on this set only touching on it. Gilliam covers a lot of material and he certainly keeps the track lively, never slowing down, which makes it a very entertaining track well worth a listen.\nThe second disc contains most of the supplements found on the second and third disc of the deluxe DVD edition Criterion released. First up is \u201dWhat is Brazil?\u201d, a 29-minute documentary made on set by Rob Hedden. It features interviews with Gilliam, Tom Stoppard, Michael Palin, Katherine Helmond, Jonathan Pryce, Charles McKeown, and others. The participants talk about the themes of the film and the look while the documentary also provides behind-the-scenes footage from the set. It also looks at the various effects and sets, as well as location shooting, like the Croydon station cooling towers for the finale. What may prove most fascinating about the piece is the inclusion of information on a dropped sequence called \u201cThe Eyeball Sequence\u201d. It seems to be a promotional piece but it\u2019s certainly an above average one, offering far more intriguing information than you would expect from something of this sort.\nA section called \u201cThe Production Notebook\u201d puts together various featurettes and galleries covering the film\u2019s production. This section actually differs greatly in comparison to a similar section found on the previous 3-disc DVD editions. A vast majority of the material was text notes you flipped through and in some cases video interviews were thrown with various participants. As you flipped through you would also, on occasion, come across a scene from the film or a behind-the-scene clip. What Criterion has done here is strip out all of the text material and kept the video segments, while attempting to upgrade the galleries to various video essays. Some of this works but unfortunately some material gets lost in the conversion.\nFirst is We\u2019re All in it Together: The Brazil Screenwriters. On the DVD this was a rather large gallery with photos of the script, storyboards, and text notes, accompanied by interviews with screenwriters Terry Gilliam, Tom Stoppard, and Charles McKeown. The whole section is now simply a 10-minute video piece featuring the interviews. Here the two talk about the development of the script, based on a script that Gilliam had already written, and there was some butting of heads, specifically on jokes. Interestingly a scene from the American version, where Sam Lowry states \u201cMy God, it works!\u201d after seeing his mother\u2019s grotesque face at the plastic surgeons, was one of the things they fought on. He took it out only to put it back in again. But since the scene is missing from the version in this set I can only assume Gilliam decided to remove it again. Stoppard was also annoyed to an extent by the fact the film seemed like 1984, but Gilliam was afraid to admit to Stoppard he never actually read the book. The segment is fine and offers a nice look at the development of the script but the text notes on the DVD offered a lot of material on the various drafts, which is completely missing here.\nDreams Unfulfilled: Unfilmed Brazil Storyboards presents the storyboards for the dream sequences. It presents nine but ultimately only one of them was filmed in its entirety and it appears sections of others, like the samurai, were added and then spread out over the film. This section was a gallery on the DVD accompanied by text notes. Here it\u2019s actually a 21-minute animated sequence narrated by David Morgan. It\u2019s a fine presentation and a decent upgrade, seeming to cover most of the material from the similar section on the DVD.\nDesigning Brazil also attempts to upgrade a couple of similar gallery sections on the DVD, though I think it loses some material. He does add some archival audio interviews with Gilliam and other members of the crew, some of which appeared in the various video clips found in the DVD\u2019s essays, and some of which sound to be newly added. Again David Morgan provides a 21-minute visual essay that goes over the visuals in the film, all the way from costumes to sets to the \u201cpropaganda\u201d to letterheads that appear throughout  the film, while also looking at the colour scheme. The DVD\u2019s section was pretty dense so I commend Morgan on fitting in so much of it. I don\u2019t think all of the material has made it from the text notes and galleries, but he still manages to offer a fascinating look at the film\u2019s visual design.\nFlights of Fantasty: Brazil\u2019s Special Effects is another visual essay by David Morgan, upgrading the DVD\u2019s similar gallery. Here, complete with behind the scenes photos, the 9-minute segment looks at how the effects were done, from the various model work to some of the camera tricks and optical effects used. It also pulls in the clips that were found on the DVD and edits in some audio clips from interviews as well. This section actually offers a decent upgrade over the DVD\u2019s section, adding in some new material not found on the old DVDs.\nFashion and Fascism: James Acheson on Brazil\u2019s Costume Design is also somewhat of an upgrade over a feature on the original DVD. The 7-minute feature presents Morgan offering a bit of an introduction on Acheson\u2019s career, and then jumps into the same audio interview with the designer found on the DVD, though it\u2019s now edited over a different set of images. He talks about how he developed the looks for the various characters from the police to Sam\u2019s dream costume and De Niro\u2019s rogue repairman outfit. He also talks about the influences of some of the more outlandish costumes, like the shoe-hat. A great discussion and I\u2019m glad it was carried over in its entirety.\nBrazil\u2019s Score is the exact same 10-minute interview featuring Gilliam and composer Michael Kamen, who talk about the film\u2019s score and how the song \u201cBrazil\u201d (which Kamen considered a Bar Mitzvah tune) became a primary influence for the film. Kamen covers most of the piece talking about how he worked in certain sounds and certain styles, while keeping that central \u201cBrazil\u201d tune. We also get clips of rough edits for certain sequences in the film which were edited together either using music from a Straus or Kamen\u2019s score for The Dead Zone. It\u2019s a strong interview, delving deep into the process of the score\u2019s development, and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s another item Criterion left untouched.\nMoving on from this section we next get to one of the biggest features on the disc, the 1996 documentary The Battle of Brazil: A Video History, a 54-minute documentary put together by Jack Mathews covering the brutal history of the film\u2019s production and release. Made up primarily of interviews it still manages to be a rather riveting documentary as it brings together everyone that had a stake in the film including Gilliam, producer Arnon Milchan, and even studio head (at the time) Sid Sheinberg. It begins with how the production came to be and how the money came together before moving on to Gilliam showing his first cut to the studio execs, where Sid Sheinberg apparently flipped out. From here we then get into the studio politics that played out, where Sheinberg insisted the film be cut down and have a happy ending tacked onto it, despite the fact Fox released the film as-is overseas with no changes. We hear from both sides of the aisle on what went down and there are some conflicts to the story, but it seems the biggest issue is that Gilliam wouldn\u2019t cut it down to the time Sheinberg wanted. Eventually, after the film was screened for critics (and Gilliam took out a big Variety ad asking Sheinberg why he hasn\u2019t released his film yet) Universal released what would become known as the American version of the film to theaters, which was shorter and had a slightly altered ending. This is easily one of the most fascinating pieces Criterion has produced for one of their releases and all these years later I still find it a gripping account. Definitely worth watching.\nThe final big feature is, of course, the \u201dLove Conquers All Version\u201d, which was apparently put together by Sheinberg. This curiosity appeared on television for a number of years, but no one seems to know exactly when it was put together or how it made it to television stations. It runs only 94-minutes and not only cuts out a lot of material (primarily dream sequences) but completely changes the nature and order of things in the film. It also has odd insertions of material trying to clarify things for audiences I can only assume Sheinberg thought were complete idiots. It flows oddly and actually makes less sense than Gilliam\u2019s film, which can admittedly take a couple of viewings to fully grasp. It also adds on a happy ending, which is bizarrely edited together from a mix of footage. It\u2019s a complete bastardization of the film, there\u2019s no doubt about it, but it\u2019s such a wonderful curiosity that ultimately shows you how important editing is to a film. David Morgan provides an audio commentary that was recorded in 1996 where he goes over the alterations and how they impact the film. Some of this is very obvious without Morgan\u2019s analysis but I still found it a decent commentary. It\u2019s a shame Gilliam didn\u2019t pa rticipate as that probably would have been a blast.\nAs to its presentation it looks the same as the DVD\u2019s, and is presented in 1080i/60hz, appearing to be upscaled. Since this was made for television I wouldn\u2019t expect a better source to exist so this is about as good as it gets.\nThe disc then closes with the film\u2019s theatrical trailer. Surprisingly the included booklet replaces Jack Mathews\u2019 essay found with all previous DVD editions with a new one by David Sterritt. Mathews participated greatly on the original Laserdisc edition so I\u2019m unsure why Criterion felt the need to provide a new essay as Mathews\u2019 was fine I thought. Sterritt\u2019s is a bit longer going into the themes of the film a bit more and recalling when he first saw the film at one of the \u201cunderground\u201d screenings Gilliam put together. Oddly he does seem a bit more enthusiastic about the film than Mathews did. It is a fine essay, but I still find it strange they replaced it.\nSadly Criterion also dumped the creative packaging of the original DVD, which presented each of the three disc in its own DVD case that was then held in a semi-transparent sleeve presenting an image of the cloudy sky seen in the dream sequences. I always thought this was one of the coolest packaging designs to ever hit the DVD market so for it not to be carried over to the Blu-ray was a bit disappointing. The discs are housed in one of Criterion\u2019s special 2-disc Blu-ray cases.\nYet again we get a solid selection of supplements, though there\u2019s still some material that feels to be missing. Yes, some material hasn\u2019t been carried over from the DVD, with the lack of information on the various drafts of the script probably being the biggest excision. But I have always felt the set was missing one critical area about the various versions of the film. There are at least four cuts of the film, two of which are presented here, and we get very little information on the European and American cuts. There\u2019s also obviously quite a bit of deleted or alternate material since the Final cut is missing material found in the others cuts, and the 94-minute version presents material not found in any cut. Still, as it is, it\u2019s a very satisfying release, one of the most impressive projects to ever come out from Criterion all these years later.\nClosing\nI think the Blu-ray offers a nice upgrade in terms of picture and sound no matter which version of the previous DVD you own (though it\u2019s obviously a bigger one over the non-anamorphic edition) so I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth getting. For fans who have never owned any of the previous Criterion editions it\u2019s definitely worth it with the supplements offering a fascinating look into one of the more interesting productions in Hollywood history. It comes with a very high recommendation.\n![](/img/cover/2D71A105-D2EC-B5DA-4040-B4D70F0AB4FB.jpg)\n![](/img/bd_small.png)",

As the clip goes on, one of the \"dead bodies\" in the background unzips the body bag and stands up. While social media users shared this clip as if it was taken in Ukraine and showed a reporter talking about the death toll, that is not what this clip shows.\nThis video was not taken in Ukraine but in Austria on Feb. 4, 2022 (about two weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine) and shows a climate protest.\nHere's the original video. Note that the chyron reads \"demo gegen klimapolitik\" (translated from German as \"Demo against climate policy\") and that the signs in the background read (translated via Google) \"Climate Protection Act Saves Lives\" and \"Not Current Climate Policy\":\nThis isn't the first time this video has been miscaptioned. USA Today addressed a different iteration of this claim on Feb. 9 when the video was shared as if it showed COVID-19 \"crisis actors.\"\nAn Austrian television clip has gained traction on social media, where some falsely claim it shows evidence of crisis actors ... The clip has been taken out of context \u2013 it does not show crisis actors in Germany. In fact, it shows climate protesters in Austria.\nAnd this isn't the first \"crisis actor\" claim to emerge during Russia's attack on Ukraine. A video showing the filming of a movie in England in 2013 was also re-captioned as if it showed Ukrainians staging an attack in 2022.

        "text": "A video of a protest demonstration in Vienna, Austria where protesters covered themselves with body bags to show lives that could be lost by climate change, is going viral with false claims that it shows Ukrainian TV faking deaths amidst Russia's invasion.\nThe video is viral amid the ongoing war in Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operations on the country. Recently, Meta (Facebook) took down several Russian accounts and pages for spreading disinfomation in Ukraine about the current situation in the country.\nThe clip is being shared on social media and WhatsApp with a caption that aims to show that Ukrainians are faking deaths to show the casualties of the Russian attack.\nThe video is being shared with text which claims, \"Ukraine live TV supposedly filming dead persons in TV killed during the invasion. But during filming one of dead woke up adjusting his /her for conformable posture\" and is viral on Facebook and Twitter.\nThe video shows a reporter speaking to the camera in German about the protests, with the background showing a rows of people in body bags when one of the people suddenly moves and removes the body bag and then is helped by a third person to put back the black body bag on himself.\nFACT CHECK\nBOOM found that the video is from Vienna, Austria and show climate change protesters holding a demonstration and is not related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nWe noticed the text 'Wien: Demo Gegen Klimapolitik' and the reporter speaking to the camera identified as Marvin Bergauer - reporter OE24.TV and using the same keywords we ran a search and found the original on YouTube. The video was uploaded by the verified handle of OE24.TV on February 4, 2022 with the same text seen on the screen which translates to - Vienna: Demo against climate policy.\nWe heard the video using translated subtitles and found that the reporter is saying that 49 protesters are laying on the ground in body bags to show the number of people who could die everyday in Austria because of climate changes.\nYou can see a screenshot of the video with the English translated captions below -\nView the video below -\nAdditionally we found a news story in N\u00d6N, Austria based media house which carried a story about the same protest with photos from the same event showing people laying on the ground in body bags.\nAccording to the photo caption in the story, in a protest organised by Fridays for Future - Austria wing, 49 people laid down outside the Austrian Federal Chancellery building.\nWe also found posts put out by Fridays For Future - Austria on February 3 on their verified Facebook page, asking people to participate in the event to be held on February 4.",

And, when global conflicts or crises are unfolding, the consequences of such widespread, incorrect understandings could have disastrous effects.\nBelow are seven videos and images that circulated widely during the 2022 war in Ukraine.\nThey include footage from a military simulation video game that spread like digital wildfire because people mistakenly believed it showed Ukrainian and Russian forces fighting, as well as several posts that attempted to downplay the violence or convince people that Russia's attack on Ukraine was justified.\nThe videos and photos are ranked in no particular order.\nDid 'Crisis Actors' Make a Propaganda Video in Ukraine?\n\u274c No. Claims that photos or videos supposedly showed \"crisis actors,\" or people pretending to be in crisis in Ukraine, were part of a disinformation campaign that ultimately attempted to grow people's distrust of anyone who considered the war a serious matter. For example, the video below wasn't related to the 2022 conflict at all; it was years-old, behind-the-scenes footage from the set of a sci-fi adventure movie.\nDoes This Video Show a Ukrainian Tank Crashing Through a Russian Barrier in 2022?\n\u274c Nope. This video \u2014 which racked up millions of views on TikTok in February and March 2022 \u2014 was actually filmed in 2014 during the Battle of Mariupol, shortly after Russia annexed Crimea.\nDid Zelenskyy 'Troll' Putin Over a Supposedly Fake Video?\n\u2753 Unproven. This rumor stems from two video clips: one supposedly showing Russian President Vladimir Putin's hand passing through a mic, and the other showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy touching a similar mic and moving it to one side. However, the illusion of the \"ghost microphone\" was caused by a low-quality video (not the result of an elaborate hoax to fool viewers), and there wasn't enough evidence to definitely say why the video of Zelenskyy showed him touching his mic.\nIs This a Real Photo of Zelenskyy Holding a Swastika Jersey?\n\u274c Nope. The image in the middle is not a genuine photo of Ukraine's president, who is Jewish. Rather, it is part of a concerted effort by Russian propagandists to depict him as a Nazi in order to justify Russia's invasion of the country. Someone made the swastika image by altering an authentic photo of Zelenskyy holding the jersey of the national team of Ukraine ahead of Euro 2020.\nIs This a Genuine Photo of Strollers that People Left in a Train Station in Poland To Help Ukrainian Refugees?\n\u2705 Yes. This photograph was taken by Francesco Malavolta, a photojournalist covering the conflict in Ukraine. He shared the photo on Twitter along with an Italian-language caption that translates to \"Strollers left at the station for women arriving from Ukraine with babies.\"\nDoes This Video Really Show Russian and Ukrainian Forces Exchanging Gunfire?\n\u274c Nope. Rather, this video was from a military simulation video game called ArmA3.\nIs This a Real News Report on Russia's Invasion of Ukraine?\n\u274c Not at all. This video that shows a reporter in front of dozens of body bags was actually taken in Austria on Feb. 4, 2022 (about two weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine), and it shows (living) environmental activists. Nevertheless, social media users shared the clip as if it was taken in Ukraine and showed a reporter talking about the war's death toll in front of actual casualties.\n\u2014 Snopes writers contributed to this report.\nSee also on Snopes:",

        "description": "Posts about detection written by Dr Ashley Tan",
        "text": "Posts Tagged \u2018detection\u2019\nTwisted Wired\nPosted April 12, 2024on:\nI like reading Wired for its well-written and informative articles about technology. But there are exceptions. One was a recent article that focused on Turnitin\u2019s ability to detect AI-generated or assisted writing.\nTo its credit, Wired was transparent in its second paragraph:\nTurnitin is owned by Advance, which also owns Cond\u00e9 Nast, publisher of WIRED.\nIt can be difficult to be critical of a parent company. So I was not surprised when it made this blanket statement:\nA study published in October found that Turnitin was among the most accurate of 16 AI language detectors in a test that had the tool examine undergraduate papers and AI-generated papers.\nIt failed to also mention that one other tool, Copyleaks, was just as accurate. In fact, the researcher declared in his paper:\nThree detectors \u2013 Copyleaks, TurnItIn, and Originality.ai \u2013 have high accuracy\u2026\nAnd:\nOverall, the detectors that require registration and payment are only slightly more accurate than the others.\nI would place less weight on the Wired article\u2019s backing of Turnitin because it quoted only parts of the research paper that backed its stance.\nIn an effort to provide balance, the article also reported how Vanderbilt University [source], Northwestern University [source, see last paragraph], and Montclair State University [source] stopped using Turnitin\u2019s AI detector. Why? Its use risked false positives and bias against learners of English language.\nReaders should only take this paragraph seriously:\nDetecting the use of gen AI is tricky. It\u2019s not as easy as flagging plagiarism, because generated text is still original text. Plus, there\u2019s nuance to how students use gen AI; some may ask chatbots to write their papers for them in large chunks or in full, while others may use the tools as an aid or a brainstorm partner.\nThat statement was honest about how people use emergent technologies. Yes, some users will break the rules and the technologies will help them do so. But that is what technologies do \u2014 they help us make new rules and create conditions for us to self-regulate.\n![](https://ashleytan.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pexels-photo-4458554.jpeg)\nSmart, not brave\nPosted August 21, 2023on:\nSome might consider Vanderbilt University\u2019s (VU) decision to disable Turnitin\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) detector to be brave. It was not. It was about making an informed decision.\nTheir full statement is worth the read. Here is one excerpt:\nWhen Turnitin launched its AI-detection tool, there were many concerns that we had. This feature was enabled for Turnitin customers with less than 24-hour advance notice, no option at the time to disable the feature, and, most importantly, no insight into how it works. At the time of launch, Turnitin claimed that its detection tool had a 1% false positive rate, but in April, Turnitin updated that number to 4% after wider usage and testing (2023). To put that into context, Vanderbilt submitted 75,000 papers to Turnitin in 2022. If this AI detection tool was available then, around 3,000 student papers would have been incorrectly labeled as having some of it written by AI. Instances of false accusations of AI usage being leveled against students at other universities have been widely reported over the past few months, including multiple instances that involved Turnitin (Fowler, 2023; Klee, 2023). In addition to the false positive issue, AI detectors have been found to be more likely to label text written by non-native English speakers as AI-written (Sample, 2023).\nVU was not just citing numbers and backing those up with narratives and prior research. In the rest of the statement, it also:\n- examined how \u201cTurnitin gives no detailed information as to how it determines if a piece of writing is AI-generated or not\u201d\n- was concerned about giving student and student-generated data to a company \u201cwith unknown privacy and data usage policies\u201d.\nIt advised its faculty to:\n- clearly communicate expectations and guidelines on AI use\n- use guidelines by APA and MLA on citing AI\n- reformat assignments if necessary, e.g., in-class work or \u201cfocusing on current issues that AI tools are not trained on\u201d\nBut it seemed wary of the last point because that was followed up quickly with this statement:\nOne key aspect to remember throughout all of this is to balance the importance of mitigating inappropriate AI usage while also being mindful of AI\u2019s benefits in the teaching and learning process.\nSo VU\u2019s decision was not brave. It was smart. It is also one of the world\u2019s leading educational institutions. How many others will follow?\nAI detector detractor\nPosted July 27, 2023on:\nMy reflection today was prompted by a TechCrunch report that OpenAI had sunset its own detection program.\nI link this to an article I read yesterday, The Pedagogical Dangers of AI Detectors for the Teaching of Writing.\nThe author, Jacob Hubbard of San Diego State University, began by recalling how a uni versity professor, Jared Mumm, wrongly accused his students of using ChatGPT and failed their papers [source].\nHubbard explained the purpose of his own research:\n\u2026Mumm used ChatGPT exclusively to detect plagiarism, despite ChatGPT not being designed to detect AI generated content. Consequently, students were unfairly accused of academic dishonesty. This alarming trend inspired me to look into how professors have used AI detection software. Because these programs are unreliable as they neither accurately nor fairly detect plagiarism, I argue there is a real danger in using these AI detection software as an effort to mitigate this issue.\nHubbard tested ZeroGPT \u201cas it was the most accessible without a paywall\u201d and had a claimed detection accuracy of up to 98%. His data were his own book chapters and well-known documents.\nWhen the author fed chapters he wrote in August and September 2022, ZeroGPT \u201cflagged parts of my writing as including AI generated content, with scores that ranged from 15% to 53% likely generated by AI/GPT.\u201d This was despite the fact that he had written those chapters on his own and ChatGPT only had training data up to 2021.\nWhen analysed by ZeroGPT, the United States Constitution had a score of 92.15%. This led the author to remark:\nI guess the Founding Fathers were using advanced technology at the time! On a more serious note, it is true these are small sample sizes, but these small sample sizes make this level of \u201cdetection\u201d questionable and troubling as a valid classroom tool.\nHe used his findings to raise three questions about so called AI detectors:\n- How confident should we be in these programs to detect AI-generated content?\n- How do the use of these AI detection programs affect the way we evaluate student work?\n- What student-teacher dynamics do the use of these AI detection programs create?\nSince such detectors are unreliable, the author suggested that we rely on more comprehensive strategies like requiring students to submit multiple drafts and demonstrate the writing process.\nHe dissuaded the use of detectors also because they exacerbate bias \u2014 students have unequal access to technology like ChatGPT and detectors tend to label the writing of non-native speakers as AI-generated. The unreliability of detectors might also foster distrust between teachers and students because the tools are a source of unfair scrutiny.\nI find no better way to conclude than to quote the questions Hubbard raised in his own conclusion:\nWhy operate under the assumption students are going to cheat? Why assume a student is going to use ChatGPT to write their essay and not put in the work? Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to work directly with students to mitigate issues of plagiarism, rather than relying on a machine to do it for us?\nBS detection Ukraine edition\nPosted March 14, 2022on:\nModern literacy should include BS detection.\nScams and falsehoods probably started the moment we became sentient, but they are easier to create and have greater reach now. So we all need to learn how to tell fact from fiction.\nWe cannot always rely on videos like the one above nor will sites like Snopes have already evaluated what we find. So how might we help ourselves?\nFor images we have reverse image search with tools like TinEye or even variants of Google image search.\nVideo reverse search is a bit more involved and might rely on reverse image search engines like Berify.\nThe tools are not in short supply and they are easy to use. The challenge is mindset. Are we cautiously sceptical and do we bother to check what we find online?\nIn 2016, much of the Internet-connected world seemed to wake up to the post-truth world.\nPeople have questioned Facebook\u2019s role in spreading fake news [some examples]. There is a Chrome extension that fact-checks Trump\u2019s tweets. Columnists and talk show hosts alike enjoy endless ammunition in the form of dubious news and information.\nWhile all this gets the attention it deserves, there are other less obvious but equally important traps to avoid. I have noticed at least three forms on Twitter.\n- The first is direct tweets, mostly from bots, that thank you for following them even though you have not. These tempt you to click on profile or embedded links. Do not do this because you do not know where those URLs lead to. Just look to see if there is a \u201cFollowing\u201d label in their profile instead.\n- There people who might include you on their \u201cmyfollowers\u201d lists. If you are not sure, click on their profiles and check if you are following them.\n- There are also some bot or bot-like accounts that might follow you. I get these on an almost daily basis and some have identical profile URLs. They are hoping you will reciprocate or hope that your real followers take notice and follow them.\nWhether the accounts claim to follow you or that you follow them, their intent is to try to artificially inflate their following or get you to click on dubious URLs. Neither is ethical behaviour.\nMy main strategy is to block all th ree types of tweet accounts. I also started compiling a list of spambots a while ago. I stopped doing this and just blocked them but recently resumed adding them to the list in case this is useful to others.\nI like to think of this sort of curative activity as pruning a garden so that weeds do not have the opportunity to grow.\nThis sort of crap detection is preventive. As you maintain an open mind, you do not leave it so open that a lot of rubbish falls in.",

        "text": "There are free tools available online to subtitle a foreign-language video, for example, in Finnish. At the end of the blog is a fact-checker for school classes.\nOn the web, there are currently countless Ven\u00e3\u00a4j\u00e3\u00a4n and Ukrainian-language videos that are used to disseminate and mislead information. Videos such as subtitles or nIit\u00e3\u00a4 are placed in a new context so that a misleading picture of the events in the video is drawn.\nIn the first part of the Edu blog series, we explained how to use a search engine and image search to review videos.\nIn the second part, we will tell you how a foreign-language video can be subtitled in Finnish and what kind of new propaganda can be disseminated. Finally, we will give the school classes a fact-checking function.\nVideo subtitle\u00c3\u00a4minen in Finnish\nEven if you don't know a word, there are free tools available online to subtitle a video in Ven\u00e3\u00a4j\u00e3\u00a4n (or spoken in another foreign language), for example, in Finnish or English.\nIt occurs, for example, in N\u00c3\u00a4in:\nHowever, it is important to note that the video review method is not missing in the name\u00c3\u00a4 without gaps, so automatic subtitling may make errors, and the program will not always make it as a result of the program..\nTransferring a video to another language is the most useful tool in situations where there is a high degree of complexity in speech. In the example of T\u00c3\u00a4m\u00e3\u00a4n's Edu blog series, where Putin's speech is subtitled, V\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00a4ristely is so r\u00c3\u00a4IKE\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00a4 that it is easy to see that T\u00c3\u00a4ll\u00e3\u00a4 Ty\u00e3\u00b6kalu is actually talking about completely different things than the Pakistani Prime Minister \u00a4, African States or Indian Territorial Dispute.\nClimate demonstration video taken out of context\u00c3\u00a4\nOne common way to disseminate disinformation, that is, intentionally misleading information, is to take the correct video or image out of context and use it to create something that is not true.\nDuring the war in Ukraine, the propaganda machine controlled by the Ven\u00e3\u00a4j\u00e3\u00a4n state has, for example, disseminated videos showing civilian victims of the war in Ukraine being brought to life. The videos are intended to create the impression that other images and videos of the war in Ukraine are false, and that these images and videos about the war in Ukraine are false and that they would not have caused civilian casualties.\nOne example of this is a video circulating on social media in which a man wearing a black respirator speaks to the camera in German. In the background, there are people lying in black body bags, one of whom begins to move. A third person\u00c3\u00b6 runs to a person lying on the ground, moving.\nThe video has been distributed on social media with the following words: \u201cIHME! The dead Ukrainians were brought back to life after they died on social media, but they were caught in a live broadcast. T\u00e3\u00a4m\u00e3\u00a4 the whole PR disaster levi\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00a4 to k\u00e3\u00a4n very quickly.\u00e2\nIn reality, the video was filmed for the Italian television channel OE24, whose reporter was reporting on the climate demonstration in Vienna. Behind the reporter, 49 protesters lie in body bags to show how many people could die every day because of climate change.\nSo the video has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine. It was uploaded to YouTube on February 4, 2022, weeks before the start of the Hy\u00c3\u00b6kk\u00e3\u00a4ys war. You can check the origin of the video using the same tools that we have presented in the blogs: a search engine, an image search, and try to translate the video into another language.\nThe same video, which has been circulated on social media as an indication of \u00e2Ukraine's lies\u00e2, has been circulated in My\u00c3\u00b6s Finland, at least on the Overboard discussion board. On the top of the board, the video is about civilian casualties in Ukraine, and for example, in an early February release, the video revealed a corona scam.\nVen\u00e3\u00a4j\u00e3\u00a4 Spreading a new kind of propaganda\nBy early March, ProPublica, an independent US investigative journalism agency, was in collaboration with Clemson University researchers to publish dozens of propaganda videos supporting Ukrainian propaganda, showing through \u201cfact-checking\u201d the activities of Ukrainians. Ely\u00e2.\nOne example of this is the presentation of an expression video taken out of context. With the help of similar videos, Ven\u00e3\u00a4j\u00e3\u00a4 therefore suggests that Ukraine has lied about something, when in reality Ven\u00e3\u00a4j\u00e3\u00a4 itself has put the lie in motion in order to be able to blame it on Ukraine.\nThe leaked expos\u00e9 videos have gained immense popularity on Telegram and Twitter, among others. According to ProPublica, a screenshot of the \u00e2expos\u00e9 videos\u00e2 has been shown on My\u00c3\u00b6s Ven\u00c3\u00a4j\u00e3\u00a4n state television.\nThe objective of the purposely published expos\u00e9 videos is to make sure that the next time they have to do it.  When, for example, photos of the Ven\u00e3\u00a4s destroyed by Ukraine online, they will determine whether the images are authentic. The goal of ven\u00e3\u00a4j\u00e3\u00a4n disinformation is to motivate recipients by eroding trust in the transmission of information and creating alternative explanations for the events.\nThe Ven\u00e3\u00a4ll\u00e3\u00a4 Ven\u00e3\u00a4ll\u00e3\u00a4s in the dark about the correct course of the war and sowing fear of the Ven\u00e3\u00a4j\u00e3\u00a4 regime seeks, for example, the will of its soldiers to fight and the will to fight on the part of the Ven\u00e3\u00a4, The people of the country came out in great masses to show their minds in the streets\nProduced in school classes\nStudents split into groups and check what the foreign-language video is all about.\nThis link is provided by the Twitterist\u00c3\u00a4 link to the climate change video presented in the context of the Twitterist\u00c3\u00a4. The German-language video has been shared on social media, saying that civilian victims of the war in Ukraine have been brought to life in the video.\nWhat's really going on with the video? Students try to check the facts with a Google search by doing an image search of the video. What are the keywords you can use to check the video? How can I find an image search?\nFinally, the video in German can be subtitled in Finnish using the presented tools.\nFor teachers: You can check the video using Google's search engine, for example, with the search words \u201cfact check ukraine bodies\u00e2 or \u00e2fact check ukraine civilians\u00e2 (without quotation marks\u201d). The search terms are used to provide a number of fact-checks on the video in question, such as the Reuters verification.\nPerform an image search of the video, make several fact-checks of the video, including the original video.\nProducts:\nProPublica: In the Ukraine Conflict, Fake Fact-Checks Are Being Used to Spread Disinformation\nNewschecker: Viral Video Claiming \u00e2Ukraine Media Faking Death Of Civilians\u00e2 Is Actually Video From Climate Change Protest\nReuters: Fact Check-Video shows climate demonstration, not staged body bags in Ukraine war",

        "text": "CNNi: Fake videos in service of anti-Ukraine propaganda\nThe propaganda war goes through the use of fake news. CNNi and journalist Daniel Dale reveal how two videos that have gone viral in relation to the war in Ukraine are completely fabricated.\nThese videos have been shared by social media accounts that essentially support Russian propaganda. As part of this, false material is used in order to \u201cprove\u201d that information and images transmitted from the battlefield are lies.\nHowever, the real lie lies in the fabricated videos used to support the theories of the supporters of the attackers.\nCNNi reveals two such examples: one video, while actually originating from a Climate Change protest in Vienna, is \u201cplaced\u201d in Ukraine.\nThe journalist - who because of the mask he is wearing is not aware of what language he is speaking - stands in front of bags where bodies are placed. However, at the Climate Change protest inside the bags were activists. In the video one of the bags is opened and the activist is seen moving. He's obviously not dead. But for social media trolls, it's a Ukrainian who makes the dead man and so... they uncovered the Ukrainian scam!\nThe video has been constructed so that the audio and text at the bottom of the screen \u201cmatches\u201d the fake \u201cscript\u201d. These figures are taken from a report by an American correspondent in Ukraine that aired on NBC.\nThe second video that the CNNi investigation reveals is being used as propaganda material against Ukraine comes from the shooting of a 2013 British science fiction film. Social media accounts circulating it in recent days claim that it is Ukrainian actors playing the terrified civilians in the war...",

Send us your questions to our WhatsApp channel: (+34) 648434618.\nWhat do we verify?\nAn alleged \u201ccorpse\u201d that moves discovers the deception of a television news report that shows false fatalities of Russian attacks in Ukraine.\nConclusion\nThe people lying on the ground are demonstrators against climate change in Austria, not false victims of the war in Ukraine, and the labels on the news have been manipulated.\nThe video apparently discovering the manipulation of a television news program to pass off living people as fatalities of the Russian Army has nothing to do with Ukraine and actually shows the television coverage of a climate change protest that took place in Vienna in early February.\nEFE Verifica has received a question on its WhatsApp channel about a video where a journalist is seen reporting in English on the number of victims of the war in Ukraine before bags of bodies arranged in rows on the floor and, suddenly, one of the bodies begins to move under the bag that covers him.\n! [] (https://i0.wp.com/verifica.efe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/victimas-ucrania-informativo-falso.jpg?resize=551%2C457&ssl=1)\nThe video, widely shared on social networks, shows how the wind threatens to reveal the body covered with the bag and, to avoid this, the person lying under it moves and even requires the help of another to position itself correctly.\n\u201cA montage made by the Ukrainian government for the world media that went wrong\u201d, states in its publication one of the profiles that broadcast the journalist's intervention to show that the video discovers a deception to make living people pass as fatalities of the Russian Army.\n! [] (https://i0.wp.com/verifica.efe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rotulo-video-victimas-ucrania.jpg?resize=642%2C389&ssl=1)\nIn some of the publications of the video on networks, the images show a sign with figures from the Ukrainian Ministry of Health about victims of the war (\u201c57 dead, 169 injured...\u201d) and the audio with the voice of a journalist also refers in English to those killed and injured by the Russian attack. This can also be seen in another video published on YouTube.\nTHEY ARE ACTIVISTS OF A CLIMATE PROTEST IN VIENNA\nIn reality, the journalist who appears in the video does not report about the victims in Ukraine, but about a protest organized by Fridays For Future in Vienna, and it is activists of this movement against climate change who can be seen lying on the ground behind the reporter, as can be seen in a YouTube post by the Austrian television channel OE24.TV.\nA reverse search for images on Google leads to the chronicle in German by journalist Marvin Bergauer about a protest organized by this movement on February 4, 2022 against the increase in carbon emissions in Austria.\n! [] (https://i0.wp.com/verifica.efe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/victima-ucrania-television-protesta-clima.jpg?resize=764%2C524&ssl=1)\nBased on a study published in the scientific journal Nature, Fridays For Future denounced with this protest that not reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Austria \u201cwould cost the lives of 49 people every day\u201d, as could be read on their official Twitter profile on February 4.\nHence, the participants in this protest act lay on the floor and covered with plastic as if they were \u201ccorpses\u201d in front of the headquarters of the Austrian Federal Chancellery, in protest against what they considered a breach of the Austrian Government's climate commitments. This was explained on Twitter together with a photograph that coincides with the place and time of the television broadcast.\n! [] (https://i0.wp.com/verifica.efe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/victimas-ucrania-informativo-television-twitter.jpg?resize=537%2C716&ssl=1)\nIn fact, in the original video, you can see some demonstrators standing, dressed in black, with hoodies and scythes, in a clear allegory of death, holding two banners with the same slogans, in German, that can be seen in the photograph published by Fridays For Future: \u201cThe climate protection law saves lives\u201d and \u201cCurrent climate policy does not\u201d.\nIn information from the Austrian media outlet Der Standard, which shares the environmental movement, activists denounce that \u201cAustria's climate protection law has been pending for 400 days\u201d and the Government of this country still lacks a clear policy on how to achieve the expected reduction in polluting emissions.\n!

[] (https://i0.wp.com/verifica.efe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/montaje-victimas-ucrania-covid-video.jpg?resize=1024%2C653&ssl=1)\nIt was also used to QUESTION the pandemic\nIt also happens that the same viral video now out of context on the occasion of the war in Ukraine had already been presented by various profiles on social networks as if it were a montage to make people believe in false fatalities of Covid-19. To this end, there were publications that made fun of the alleged dead man who was moving under the plastic bag and defined the scene as a \u201cmiracle of pandemic change\u201d.\nEven then, it was possible to see how the journalist in the video explained in German that it was a protest organized by Fridays For Future and how the label, written in that language, indicated: \u201cVienna: demonstration against climate policy\u201d.\nAnd, in the post he shared on Twitter on February 4, that environmental movement specified that 50 activists had pretended to be \u201cdead\u201d in front of the Federal Chancellery to symbolize those who died prematurely due to the climate crisis.\nAs in this case, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, EFE Verifica has demonstrated the falsehood of numerous publications attributed to this crisis and also, on the contrary, how some images questioned on social networks and presented as supposedly unrelated to the conflict did reflect real events of the war.\nIn short, the viral television broadcast on networks is not a montage to deceive people into believing in the existence of fatalities of the war (or of the coronavirus), but rather a journalistic chronicle of a protest in Vienna by the Fridays For Future movement against Austrian climate policy.\nSOURCES:\nReverse image search on Google.\nOriginal video about the Fridays For Future climate protest on the OE24.TV YouTube channel.\nInformation from the television channel NBC NEWS: \u201cAt least 57 dead and 169 injured after Russian attack on Ukraine\u201d.\nArticle from the Austrian media Der Standard: \u201cClimate activists protest at Heldenplatz: There is no climate protection law for 400 days\u201d.",

        "text": "On March 1, Facebook user Liudmila Jecheva Andonova posted a video showing people wrapped in black bags behind the journalist's back. One of them opens the bag, after which the girl comes running to it and covers the black bag again. The author of the post claims that a video about the humanitarian disaster in Ukraine is being shot in Poland using false corpses.\nAs of March 4, Liudmila Jecheva Andonova's post has been shared more than 1,000 times. The post was later shared on the following Facebook groups: Russian Canada-Russian Canada, Estonian Fraudsters, Estonian News, Nash Lasnam\u00e4e.\nThe video is distributed with a fake description and does not reflect footage shot to illustrate the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine, but a performance held in Austria on February 4 in protest against climate policy. By creating imitations of corpses, activists emphasize that the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide will eventually lead to human casualties. A similar video was distributed in Georgia with a false description to deny the pandemic even before Russia attacked Ukraine.\nThe video, posted by Liudmila user Jecheva Andonova, was not shot in Poland to demonstrate the humanitarian disaster in Ukraine. The video was shot even before the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war, on February 4 in Austria and reflects a protest over climate policy.\nThis video was tested by Myth Detector in February, when Georgian-speaking Facebook users used the footage to illustrate a simulation of deaths from Covid.\nAs a result of the audit, it turned out that the authentic video was shot in the Austrian capital Vienna and the story belongs to the Austrian television station OE24tv. According to an article published on oe24.at, activists performed outside the Federal Chancellery on February 4. The performance included an imitation of 49 corpses wrapped in black bags. Performance participants referred to an international study according to which every 4,000 tons of CO2 leads to the death of 1 person, which means 49 deaths in Austria by 2100, and that corpses were used for climate-related performance.\nThe video is cut in such a way that the credits are not fully visible; only the journalist's first and last names are read. Part of the video showing protesters holding banners was also cut out. One of the banners says \u201cAKTUELL KLIMAPOLITIK NICHT\u201d, which means \u201cNo to existing climate policy\u201d in Russian.\nConsequently, the information disseminated is a video manipulation and its description is fake.\nRead the Myth Detector article in detail on this topic:\nA \u201crestless corpse\u201d or a protest over the climate?\nThis article was prepared as part of the Facebook Fact-Check Program, based on materials on which Facebook may use various restrictions based on this article.

She birthed 69 babies total in her lifetime! It sounds unbelievable. But here's her bizarre, yet true story.\nWhen Michelle Duggar had 17 kids, her family got their own TV show: 17 Kids And Counting. Of course, then it became 19 Kids And Counting after Michelle birthed two more babies. But as it turns out, the modern-day Duggars have nothing on the 18th-century Russian Vassilyevs.\nRELATED: 65-Year-Old Mother Of 13 Decides To Get Pregnant, Then Gives Birth To Quadruplets\nHistory records Feodor Vassilyev as a farmer in Shuya, Russia during the 1700's. But it's his wife who caught the attention of the Guinness Book of World Records. She's recognized as the most prolific mother ever after birthing 69 babies, snagging the world record for most children born to one mother.\nThere's some question as to whether or not Mrs. Vassilyev's real name is known, but some sources call her Valentina. And it's reported that between the years of 1725 to 1765, she gave birth to four sets of quadruplets, seven sets of triplets, and 16 pairs of twins. That's 69 babies total, with 67 living beyond infancy!\nThe Math Behind 1 Mom And 69 Babies\n4 x 4 = 16\n7 x 3 = 21\n16 x 2 = 32\n----------\n27 births, 69 children\nGuinness Records Specialists do suggest taking the exact number of babies with a grain of salt, given that 18th-century Russian record keeping could be off just a bit. However, they also point out that these numbers, while extreme, are actually in the realm of possibility.\nLet's take another look at the Duggars as a modern-day comparison.\nA Rare, Yet Probable Case\nThe Duggars had their first child in 1988 when Michelle would have been 21. Soon after, Michelle had a miscarriage where the couple feared birth control may have played a role. That's when the Christian couple abandoned birth control altogether and completely surrendered to the will of God. They decided to let Him determine their number of children.\nMichelle Duggar gave birth 17 times (twice with twins) over a period of 21 and a half years. So, considering the likelihood that Valentina was even younger when she began bearing children, it's possible she could have had 27 pregnancies during her fertile years.\nResearchers also point to the possibility that Valentina may have had a genetic predisposition for hyperovulation. This is where a woman releases multiple eggs in one cycle, greatly increasing the odds of multiples.\nValentina's 27 pregnancies is certainly incredible. But as an equally interesting side note, her husband, Feodor, went on to have even more children!\nRELATED: 15 Bizarre Stories That Couldn\u2019t Possibly Be True (But Absolutely Are)\nRecords say Feodor later remarried. And his second wife gave birth to six pairs of twins and two sets of triplets, making for 18 children in 8 pregnancies. That means Feodor fathered 87 children total in his lifetime!\n18-Century Documents Supporting The World Record\nIndeed, this was considered a jaw-dropping feat even then and supposedly the Monastery of Nikolsk reported it to the Moscow government in 1782. And when the French Academy looked into the authenticity, supposedly the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg told them no verification was needed. Apparently, the sons and daughters of the Vassilyevs lived in Moscow and received government assistance to help support the huge family.\nSadly, these records did not include any confirmed photographs of the Vassilyev family. The photograph included in this article began circulating with this bizarre story, but no one has been able to confirm it actually depicts Feodor, Valentina, and their children. Instead, it serves as an illustrative example only.\nThroughout the years, another photograph became affiliated with this story by mistake.\nHowever, the black and white photograph is actually of Joseph F. Smith from an article about polygamy published in the Utah Historical Quarterly.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Joanna Gaines Opens Up About The Gift Of Her Unexpected Pregnancy\nThe story of Valentina's 69 babies is certainly mind-blowing.

        "text": "The Guinness World Record for most children born to one mother goes to Valentina Vassilyev, the wife of a Russian peasant Feodor Vassilyev. She birthed 69 babies total in her lifetime. She lived to be 76 and, between 1725 and 1765, had 69 children (16 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets and 4 sets of quadruplets) 67 of them survived infancy with the loss of one set of twins.\nHistory records Feodor Vassilyev as a farmer in Shuya, Russia during the 1700\u2019s. But it\u2019s his wife who caught the attention of the Guinness Book of World Records. Valentina is recognized as the most prolific mother ever after birthing 69 babies, snagging the world record for most children born to one mother.\nThe Math Behind 1 Mom And 69 Babies\n4 x 4 = 16\n7 x 3 = 21\n16 x 2 = 32\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n27 births, 69 children\nThe first published account about Feodor Vassilyev\u2019s children appeared in a 1783 issue of The Gentleman\u2019s Magazine (Vol. 53 p. 753, London, 1783) and states that the information \u201chowever astonishing, may be depended upon, as it came directly from an English merchant in St Petersburg to his relatives in England, who added that the peasant was to be introduced to the Empress\u201d. The same numbers were given in Ivan Nikitich Boltin\u2019s 1788 commentary on Russian history and in an 1834 book by Alexander Pavlovich Bashutskiy, Saint Petersburg Panorama.\nSeveral published sources raised doubts as to the veracity of these claims. According to a 1933 article by Julia Bell in Biometrika, a 1790 book of B. F. J. Hermann Statistische Schilderung von Ru\u00dfland did provide the claims about Feodor Vassilyev\u2019s children but \u201cwith a caution\u201d. Bell also notes that the case was reported by The Lancet in an 1878 article about the study of twins. The Lancet article states that the French Academy of Sciences attempted to verify the claims about Vassilyev\u2019s children and contacted \u201cM. Khanikoff of the Imperial Academy of St Petersburg for advice as to the means they should pursue, but were told by him that all investigation was superfluous, that members of the family still lived in Moscow and that they had been the object of favors from the Government\u201d.\nBell concludes that Vassilyev\u2019s case \u201cmust be regarded as under suspicion\u201d. Similarly, Marie Clay in a 1998 book notes: \u201cSadly, this evasion of proper investigation seems, in retrospect, to have dealt a terminal blow to our chances of ever establishing the true detail of this extraordinary case\u201d.\nThe data about Vassilyev\u2019s children are included in the Guinness Book of World Records.\nValentina\u2019s 27 pregnancies is certainly incredible.

        "text": "Published: May 09, 2013, 11:59 IST Updated: May 16, 2013, 06:51 IST\nFascinating Mothers From Around The World\nYou\u2019re reading this because your mother chose to bring you into the world. Giving birth is a miracle, one of the most under-acknowledged feats ever. As we gear up for mother\u2019s day, MensXP take a look at few of these miracles that have defied t\n1. Oldest Mother In The WorldThe honor for the oldest mother in the world goes to a 70-year-old Indian, Omkari Singh. In spite of having two daughters and five grand-children, the\n__READMORE__Singhs were keen on having a baby boy and they achieved it through vitro-fertilization. Singh fgave birth to twins, a boy and a girl by Caesarean section. The doctors are confident that the healthy babies will survive despite their mother\u2019s old age. (Image Credit: lindaikeji (dot) blogspot (dot) com)\n2. Youngest Mother In The WorldThe tragic conception of a baby to a 5-year-old is a disheartening fact. This case came into the limelight on May 14,\n__READMORE__1933, when 5 year and 7 month old Lina Medina of Peru got pregnant. She gave birth to a 2.64 kg healthy baby in her hometown. The child was delivered by the Caesarean section and was reported to be healthy enough to survive. Her father was arrested under suspicion of raping her but was released due to lack of evidence. The father\u2019s identity remained a mystery. (Image Credit: 4 (dot) bp (dot) blogspot (dot) com)\n3. Mother With The Most BabiesThe official record of a mother for having the most babies throughout a lifetime is held by Russia\u2019s Feodor Vassilyev. Feodor had 27 different\n__READMORE__conceptions, and gave birth to 69 babies! Born in 1707, Feodor and her husband raised 67 children who survived, while only two failed to survive their infancy. Feodor achieved this feat by giving birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets. Simply fascinating! (Image Credit: temmais (dot) com)\n4. Most Multiples Born To A MotherThe highest number of babies born to a mother at one time were nonuplets - a set of nine children. This has been recorded twice in human history, in\n__READMORE__1971 and 1999, albeit none of the babies survived during both the instances. Fascinatingly, the most successful conception took place in 2009, when Nadya Suleman gave birth to two healthy boys and six girls in California, United States. These octuplets were conceived by in vitro fertilization and survived infancy! (Image Credit: ssheltonimages (dot) com)\n5. Most Children Born To A Surrogate MotherSurrogacy is a boon in itself. And Carole Horlock is at the top of the good Karma list when she gave birth to 13 babies in her 13-year surrogate career. Not just\n__READMORE__that, she was capable of conceiving a set of triplets for a Greek couple in 2008. This fascinating surrogate mom finally quit after the thirteenth delivery. Talk about good deeds! (Image Credit: dailymail (dot) co (dot) uk)",

        "text": "The Guinness World Record for most children born to one mother goes to Valentina Vassilyev, the wife of a Russian peasant . She birthed 69 babies total in her lifetime.\nShe lived to be 76 and, between 1725 and 1765, had 69 children (16 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets and 4 sets of quadruplets) 67 of them survived infancy with the loss of one set of twins.\nHistory records Feodor Vassilyev as a farmer in Shuya, Russia during the 1700\u2019s. But it\u2019s his wife who caught the attention of the Guinness Book of World Records. Valentina is recognized as the most prolific mother ever after birthing 69 babies, snagging the world record for most children born to one mother.\nThe Math Behind 1 Mom And 69 Babies\n4 x 4 = 16\n7 x 3 = 21\n16 x 2 = 32\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n27 births, 69 children\nThe first published account about Feodor Vassilyev\u2019s children appeared in a 1783 issue of The Gentleman\u2019s Magazine (Vol. 53 p. 753, London, 1783) and states that the information \u201chowever astonishing, may be depended upon, as it came directly from an English merchant in St Petersburg to his relatives in England, who added that the peasant was to be introduced to the Empress\u201d. The same numbers were given in Ivan Nikitich Boltin\u2019s 1788 commentary on Russian history and in an 1834 book by Alexander Pavlovich Bashutskiy, Saint Petersburg Panorama.\nSeveral published sources raised doubts as to the veracity of these claims. According to a 1933 article by Julia Bell in Biometrika, a 1790 book of B. F. J. Hermann Statistische Schilderung von Ru\u00dfland did provide the claims about Feodor Vassilyev\u2019s children but \u201cwith a caution\u201d. Bell also notes that the case was reported by The Lancet in an 1878 article about the study of twins. The Lancet article states that the French Academy of Sciences attempted to verify the claims about Vassilyev\u2019s children and contacted \u201cM. Khanikoff of the Imperial Academy of St Petersburg for advice as to the means they should pursue, but were told by him that all investigation was superfluous, that members of the family still lived in Moscow and that they had been the object of favors from the Government\u201d.\nThe data about Vassilyev\u2019s children are included in the Guinness Book of World Records.\nValentina\u2019s 27 pregnancies is certainly incredible. But as an equally interesting side note, her husband, Feodor, went on to have even more children.\nVassilyev also had 18 children with his second wife, who had 6 pairs of twins and 2 sets of triplets, making him a father of 87 children in total. Of his 87 children, at least 82 are said to have survived infancy.\nSadly, there is no confirmed photographs of the Vassilyev family. The photograph included in this article began circulating with this bizarre story, but no one has been able to confirm it actually depicts Feodor, Valentina, and their children. Instead, it serves as an illustrative example only.\nAlthough this historic record for the most kids by one woman should be taken with a pinch of salt, it is certainly conceivable that Mrs Vassilyev could have had a genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate (release multiple eggs in one cycle), which significantly increases the chance of having twins or multiple children.",

Sanctions \"against those responsible for violence and use of excessive force\" are expected.\nAnti-government protests in Ukraine reached their most violent point on Tuesday as at least 25 people were killed and hundreds injured amid violent clashes between police and citizens.\nThe protests have evolved into a full-blown crisis on the ground. What happens now is critical to the geopolitical struggle between Russia and the West.\nThe crisis began on November 21, 2013, when Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych snubbed a plan to sign an Association Agreement and trade pact with the EU after Russia persuaded the most populous former Soviet republic to stay in the Kremlin's orbit.\nCitizens subsequently flooded the streets and made Independence Square, aka Maidan, their base in central Kiev. The confrontations between the opposition and Yanukovych's government have been escalating since.\nOn Wednesday, people poured back into Maidan to prepare for fresh clashes with police. (Here's a Maidan live stream.)\nFrom riot police using ancient military tactics to defend against attacks to streets engulfed in flames, the photos coming for the heart of the standoff are incredible.",

The picture shared in the post is old and has nothing to do with the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Hence, the post shared in the post is MISLEADING.\nOn reverse image search of the second photo shared in the post, a similar photo was found in an article published by the \u2018ABC\u2019 news website on 20 February 2014. According to the article, in February 2014, violent clashes erupted between the anti-government protestors and Ukraine Security forces in Kyiv, the Capital city of Ukraine. These protests reportedly started in 2013 after the then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych spurned a European trade and political deal and instead sealed a $15 billion bailout from Russia. Several demonstrators and Police reportedly lost their lives in these violent clashes that took place in Kyiv. The photo shared in the post shows the International Square (also called Maidan Square) after the Kyiv riots in 2014.\n![](https://factly.in/wp-content/uploads//2022/02/Before-and-after-Russian-invasion-pictures-at-Indpendence-Square-in-Ukraine-Image-1.jpg)\nReporting the same, several news websites have published articles in February 2014. They can be seen here, here, and here. Amie Ferris-Rotman, a journalist who worked in several international news organizations had compared pictures of Kyiv\u2019s International Square before and after the violent riots similarly in 2014.\n![](https://factly.in/wp-content/uploads//2022/02/Before-and-after-Russian-invasion-pictures-at-Indpendence-Square-in-Ukraine-Image-2.jpg)\nThe latest visuals of Kyiv\u2019s Maidan Square after the Russian advance in Ukraine can be seen here. From all these pieces of evidence, it can be concluded that the image shared in the post is old and has nothing to do with the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n![](https://factly.in/wp-content/uploads//2022/02/Before-and-after-Russian-invasion-pictures-at-Indpendence-Square-in-Ukraine-Image-3.jpg)\nTo sum it up, a 2014 photo is being shared as the picture of Kyiv\u2019s Independence Square after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",

An opposition militant in a helmet was filmed firing from behind a tree.\nIn the image above, anti-government protesters detain a wounded policeman during the fighting in Independence Square.\nInterior Minister Vitaly Zakharchenko said police had been issued with combat weapons and would use them \"in accordance with the law\" to defend themselves - or to free 67 of their colleagues his ministry said were being held captive.\nDemonstrators said captured police had been allowed to go.\nThe bloodshed, in which both sides used firearms, traumatised many in the Ukraine, where a 2004-05 Orange Revolution for democracy passed off largely peacefully.\nIt also heightened concern voiced by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk that Ukraine could descend into civil war or split between the pro-European west and Russian-speaking east.\nIn a bid to end the crisis, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich on February 21 signed an agreement with three opposition leaders.\nThe deal sets out plans to hold early presidential elections, form a national unity government and revert to the 2004 constitution, removing some of the president\u00e2s powers.\nSlideshow\nAnti-government protesters throw missiles during clashes with riot police in Independence Square.\nA protester shoots an improvised device during fighting in the plaza.\nAnti-government protesters carry an injured man on a stretcher as flames flare.\nRiot police attack anti-government protesters.\nTwo men, their faces covered with blood, are seen after clashes with riot police.\nA wounded man lies in front of a barricade.\nA woman covers her eyes in front of dead bodies lying on the ground.\nAn anti-government protester pays his respects to a fallen comrade.\nProtesters prepare Molotov cocktails during clashes.\nDemonstrators use a sling to fire objects at members of the Interior Ministry and riot police.\nAn anti-government protester stands behind his shield during the violence.\nA protester aims a rifle during clashes with riot police.\nA protester holds a Ukranian flag as he advances through burning barricades.\nAnother protesters rests, wrapped in a flag.\nA medic cleans a protester\u00e2s eyes.\nAnti-government protesters listen to speeches by their leaders in Independence Square.\nA man holds his dead son\u00e2s hand as over a dozen corpses are transferred from a hotel lobby to a local hospital after clashes with riot police.\nA priest performs the last rites on the body of an anti-government protester.\nRows of protesters sleep in Kiev\u00e2s City Hall.\nSmoke billows from Independence Square during clashes between protesters and police.",

We begin our journey from Maydan \u2013 Kyiv main square and the 2013-2014 revolution centre. Our guide, who was the eyewitness of the historic moment, will share his memories of those shocking events. We stroll to the mysterious Chimaera House and the monumental presidential palace along the street, where in 2014 the demonstrators equipped only with wooden shields marched against the police\u2019s bullets. After visiting the government quarter we travel out of the city to the residence of the former president, who fled during the revolution. It used to be the most secret place hidden behind the 5-metre walls heavily guarded by armed men with dogs. Nowadays it\u2019s the Museum of Corruption. There was even a personal air defense system. Explore 137 hectares of parks and lakes on an electric car. There is everything you can imagine \u2013 the ship-restaurant, the heliport, the zoo, the collection of retro cars, golf court, fountains and SPAs \u2013 it was still not enough. The true gem of the residence is the masterpiece of Finnish design \u2013 Honka. It is a modern 600 square meter palace made of unique kelo wood. Walk the underground tunnel guarded by a stuffed lion and the knights, admire royal parquet flooring and wood engravings, hear the stories about the golden loaf and other stupid whims of the dictator. Our guide is a former demonstrator, who was among the first to enter the mansion and has been living there ever since. He committed himself to maintain and protect the house.

        "text": "A set of two photographs showing Ukraine's Independence Square at Kyiv are being shared on social media, which purportedly show the condition of the square five days apart, on 20 February and 25 February. The first shows what the area looks like on a regular day, whereas the second one shows ash, fire, smoke and rubble surrounding it.\nThe photos are being shared claiming to show a damaged Independence Square in Kyiv on 25 February, a day after Russian forces started invading Ukraine.\nHowever, the claim is misleading. We found that the second photo being shared as a recent visual of the damaged Independence Square is actually from 2014, when large scale anti-government protests erupted in the Ukrainian capital. Activists and protesters had set up camps and barricades around the city's square.\nCLAIM\nThe photographs showing the Independence Square at Kyiv in Ukraine are being shared to claim that it shows the 'before' and 'after' situation of the area, a day after Russia announced Ukraine's invasion.\nWHAT WE FOUND OUT\nWe ran a reverse image search on the photo of the damaged Square on Google, and the results led us to the same photo in articles by Canada's CBC News and The Atlantic. Both articles were published in February 2014 and discussed anti-government protests in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nThe photo's caption noted that it showed an \"aerial view\" of the Independence Square in Kyiv, \"during clashes between anti-government protesters and riot police\" on 19 February and credited it to Reuters' Olga Yakimovich.\nUsing relevant keywords, we looked for the photo on Reuters' website, which led us to the same photo as the claim, along with a description noting that it was taken on 19 February 2014.\nThe description said that the photo showed clashes between anti-government protesters and Interior Ministry members and riot police in central Kyiv, Ukraine.\nWe looked up news reports on the same for additional context.\nA detailed explainer by CNN noted that the protests at Kyiv's Independence Square, also known as Maidan, erupted after former President Viktor Yanukovych suspended talks regarding a \"historical political and trade agreement\" with the European Union (EU). Russia had threatened Ukraine with sanctions and a hike in fuel rates if the agreement was signed.\nUkrainians were strongly in support of the EU agreement, and as the protests intensified, an anti-protest law was passed by the Ukrainian parliament, raising questions about curtailing people's right to free speech and protests.\nThis led to further escalations where the protesters occupied the area for three months, eventually leading to clashes between them and riot police.\nWHAT ABOUT KYIV'S INDEPENDENCE SQUARE?\nWe looked for news reports on any damage to Kyiv's Independence Square but did not come across any. However, we found tweets from verified Ukrainian media outlets that showed recent visuals of the Square.\nOn 4 March, The Kyiv Independent tweeted photographs of anti-tank structures being placed around the Independence Square.\nWe also came across a photo of the Square, undamaged, dated 2 March, 2022 on Getty Images.\n(Note: Swipe right to view both images.)\nA photo taken on 2 March shows no damage to the area.\n(Source: Getty Images/Screenshot)\nEvidently, the Independence Square in Ukraine's Kyiv has not been affected by the Russian invasion as of 7 March 2022. The photo being shared to claim that the structure had been damaged by 25 February is actually from February 2014, when clashes broke out between anti-government protesters and riot police.\n(Not convinced of a post or information you came across online and want it verified?

In his speech to the Russian public on Monday night, a sometimes sullen, sometimes angry-sounding Putin was dismissive of modern-day Ukraine, arguing that its creation as a sovereign state was a tragedy and an accident of communist leaders in the 20th century.\nActing as though there had never been a historical Ukraine until Soviet times, Putin blamed at times Vladimir Lenin, at times Stalin and at one point he saved scorn for the decision of Nikita Khrushchev to take Crimea from Russia in 1954 and award it to Ukraine.\nAs with all historical narratives, there were elements of truth in what Putin was saying. Ukrainians and Russians are related eastern Slavic peoples whose destinies have been both intertwined and separated throughout history.\n5 View gallery\n![Ukrainian flag in Kiev (Photo: AP) \u05d3\u05d2\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d9\u05d9\u05d1 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dd \u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05d4](https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver5/crop_images/2022/02/16/H1zUu7c1q/H1zUu7c1q_0_0_3000_1999_0_x-large.jpg)\n![Ukrainian flag in Kiev (Photo: AP) \u05d3\u05d2\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d9\u05d9\u05d1 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dd \u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05d4](https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver5/crop_images/2022/02/16/H1zUu7c1q/H1zUu7c1q_0_0_3000_1999_0_x-large.jpg)\nUkrainian flag in Kiev\n(Photo: AP)\nBut he preferred to focus on the time of Russia\u2019s maximum dominance over Ukraine \u2014 neatly forgetting that it has been a separate state recognized by international treaties and explicitly by Russia over the last 30 years. Instead, he painted today\u2019s Ukraine as a corrupt, barely functioning puppet of the United States that threatens Russia\u2019s security and, in his view, has no real reason to exist except in union with Russia.\nBoth Ukraine and Russia trace themselves to Kievan Rus, a trading center set up by Vikings along the Dnieper River more than 1,000 years ago, before Moscow even existed, that was originally pagan and later embraced Orthodox Christianity. Kievan Rus fell afterward to the early 13th century Mongol invasions of Europe. Muscovy did not emerge from being a vassal state until the late 15th century.\nInstead of being connected to Russian Moscow, all of what is now Ukraine instead for centuri es was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 1300s, and later of the Union of Poland and Lithuania, a vast multilingual, multiethnic state whose territory encompassed almost all of what is now Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine (and parts of what is now Russia.)\nIn its eastern and southeastern regions, the union\u2019s dominant languages were Polish and Ruthenian, the predecessor to modern-day Ukrainian and Belarusian. The population included Ukrainians, Poles, Belarusians, Lithuanians, Jews and Tartars.\n5 View gallery\n![A worker in front of a statue of Lenin prepares for the dismantling of the monument in Kiev back in 1991 (Photo: AP) A worker in front of a statue of Lenin prepares for the dismantling of the monument in Kiev on Friday, Aug. 30, 1991.

Western Ukraine remained part of the Polish-Lithuanian Union for another 150 years, until Poland was partitioned for the final time in 1795 and erased from the map of Europe.\nPoland rose again after World War I and fought a territorial war with Soviet Russia between 1919 and 1922, winning back much of Ukraine. Those lands returned to Soviet control a generation later during and after World War II, but after the war Ukrainian nationalist partisans fought on against the Soviets in a guerrilla resistance for several years.\n5 View gallery\n![An unidentified general in a former Soviet army uniform, holds a red flag during a rally on the occasion of the 78th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, in Kiev back in 1995 (Photo: AP) An unidentified general in a former Soviet army uniform, holds a red flag during a rally on the occasion of the 78th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, in Kiev](https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver5/crop_images/2022/02/22/r1WBoUzg5/r1WBoUzg5_0_0_1000_712_0_x-large.jpg)\n![An unidentified general in a former Soviet army uniform, holds a red flag during a rally on the occasion of the 78th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, in Kiev back in 1995 (Photo: AP) An unidentified general in a former Soviet army uniform, holds a red flag during a rally on the occasion of the 78th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, in Kiev](https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver5/crop_images/2022/02/22/r1WBoUzg5/r1WBoUzg5_0_0_1000_712_0_x-large.jpg)\nAn unidentified general in a former Soviet army uniform, holds a red flag during a rally on the occasion of the 78th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, in Kiev back in 1995\n(Photo: AP)\nIt addressed the reality of Ukraine\u2019s separate history and identity, poised somewhere between Moscow and the West for most of its existence, but never given the chance to rule itself until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nContrary to Putin, most Ukrainians do not clamor to be part of Russia today, and anti-Russian sentiment in most of the country has only increased since Russia\u2019s 2014 seizure of Crimea and the taking of the Donbas region by pro-Moscow separatists.\nNow with Russian troops marching into the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine again, it looks as though the millennial-long tug of war for dominance in the area, with the use of force of arms or diplomacy as needed, is about to renew again.",

And Ukrainians are wondering how far Russia will go to get the outcome it wants in the crisis.\nMoscow is strongly supporting Ukraine's embattled president, Viktor Yanukovych. Russian news media \u2014 nowadays almost all under state control \u2014 are spinning the crisis, says Julia Ioffe, senior editor with The New Republic.\n\"Mostly on Russian TV you're seeing reports that this is a band of radicals \u2014 right-wing fascist radicals who are trying to stage a violent coup,\" she adds. There is no suggestion this is a popular movement: instead Russian news suggests innocent civilians are trapped and being used as \"hostages,\" says Ioffe. \"The only casualties we hear about are the cops and special forces officers.\"\nUkraine broke away from the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War, after centuries under Moscow's domination. Even today, a large minority of Ukrainian citizens are ethnically Russian. But Moscow's interests in Ukraine are mostly geopolitical and economic, says Ioffe. Moscow doesn't want to see \"NATO and the European Union expand to Russia's doorstep.\"\n\"Very famously,\" Ioffe says, \"Vladimir Putin is said to have said to George W. Bush back in 2008 that Ukraine is not a real country. He sees Ukraine very much as an extension of Russia. Basically a province of Russia that through an accident of history has its own borders, its own government and its own foreign policy.\"\nIoffe says some in Russia even call Ukraine 'Little Russia' or 'Minor Russia.'\nPutin is sending billions of dollars in aid to prop up Yanukovych, and he could also provide equipment, training and \"reinforcements,\" if need-be.\nMany Ukrainian protesters fear Russia could intervene more directly. \"There are constant allusions to this\" in Russian media, says Ioffe. Russians she says \"keep waiting for the news to flash across the wires\" that Russian troops have intervened in Ukraine. But Ioffe says Moscow probably does not want to do this. \"But as we've seen in Georgia, when it comes to Russia's 'near-abroad' and its backyard, it's not loathe to put its money where its mouth is, or its soldiers where its mouth is.\"",

        "text": "A Dictator's Guide to Urban Design\nUkraine's Independence Square, and the revolutionary dimensions of public spaces.\n![](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/DEoQQXf2kIKnoVIEbPpjYaWbeG8=/0x182:3500x2151/960x540/media/img/mt/2014/02/RTX193O1/original.jpg)\nUkraine is the size of Texas, but for the last three months its burgeoning protest movement has largely crowded into the space of 10 city blocks.\nThe name for the movement itself, Euromaidan, is a neologism fusing the prefix euro, a nod to the opposition's desire to move closer to the EU and away from Russia, with the Ukrainian (and originally Persian and Arabic) word maidan, or public square. And the term is about more than situating the demonstrations in Kiev's Independence Square (Maidan Nezalezhnosti). Ukraine may be located in Europe geographically, but many of the protesters also see Europe as an idea, one that \"implies genuine democracy, trustworthy police and sincere respect for human rights.\"\nThe name speaks to an increasingly universal phenomenon as well: the public square as an epicenter of democratic expression and protest, and the lack of one\u2014or the deliberate manipulation of such a space\u2014as a way for autocrats to squash dissent through urban design.\nNot all revolutions have been centered in public squares, but many recent ones have, including several in former Soviet states. Georgia's Rose Revolution in 2003 toppled President Eduard Shevardnadze from Tbilisi's Freedom Square. Kyrgyz protesters seized Ala-Too Square from police in 2005, then promptly stormed the nearby presidential palace and ousted long-time President Askar Akayev. Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2004 took place in the same Independence Square where protesters have now engaged in bloody clashes with government forces, wringing promises from President Viktor Yanukovych for early elections and a return to the 2004 constitution.\nThe symbolism of the public square gained new potency during the Arab Spring. An essayist writing in the heady days of the Egyptian revolution, shortly after Hosni Mubarak's downfall in 2011, eloquently explained how Tahrir Square represented the broader repression of Egyptian civil society. The square was originally built in the 19th century based on a \"Paris on the Nile\" design for Cairo, and renamed Tahrir (Liberation) Square when it became a focal point for the Egyptian revolutions of 1919 and 1952:\nIndeed, in the past few weeks Tahrir has became a truly public square. Before it was merely a big and busy traffic circle\u2014and again, its limitations were the result of political design, of policies that not only discouraged but also prohibited public assembly. Under emergency law\u2014established from the moment Mubarak took office in 1981 and yet to be lifted\u2014a gathering of even a few adults in a public square would constitute cause for arrest. Like all autocracies, the Mubarak government understood the power of a true public square, of a place where citizens meet, mingle, promenade, gather, protest, perform and share ideas; it understood that a true midan\u2014Arabic for public square\u2014is a physical manifestation of democracy. A truly public Midan al-Tahrir would have been feared as a threat to regime security, and so over the years the state deployed the physical design of urban space as one of its chief means of discouraging democracy.\nIn Tahrir this meant erecting fences and subdividing open areas into manageable plots of grass and sidewalks. To cite one prominent example: the large portion of the square that fronts the Egyptian museum was, until the 1960s, a grassy plaza with crisscrossing paths and a grand fountain. Here families and students would gather throughout the day; it was also a notorious meeting point for lovers on a date in the heart of the city. But in the 1970s, the government fenced off the area\u2014and more, it never offered any clear explanation of what was to be the fate of this favorite meeting spot. Cairenes speculated that perhaps it was closed to allow for construction of the Cairo Metro or other infrastructure projects. Sometime in the past decade a sign appeared, announcing that a multi-level underground parking garage was being built. During the protests in Tahrir Square, activists took down the fence and used it to build barricades to protect themselves from the attacks of pro-Mubarak thugs\u2014and the removal of the fence revealed that none of the promised construction had ever taken place. The area had been taken away from the public sphere precisely to avoid the possibility of large crowds congregating in Tahrir. Such was Mubarak\u2019s urban planning legacy.\nCairo's layout also made Tahrir Square the perfect place to launch a revolution. Centrally located in Egypt's largest city, Tahrir sits near the Egyptian parliament, Mubarak's political party headquarters, the presidential palace, numerous foreign embassies, and hotels filled with international journalists to broadcast footage of the protests for audiences around the world. After Mubarak ste pped down, large public squares in other Arab capitals became revolutionary battlegrounds as well.\nFor Libya, Tripoli's main public square has come to symbolize the success of the country's 2011 revolution. Originally named Piazza Italia under Italian colonial rule (Western European-inspired central squares are a common theme in this part of the world) and then Independence Square by the Libyan monarchy, it had been renamed \"Green Square\" after Muammar Qaddafi's political ideology. Libya's transitional government promptly renamed it Martyrs' Square after those who died fighting Qaddafi's regime in Libya's civil war.\nBut these public spaces don't always survive the revolutionary moments that make them famous. Bahrain's most prominent public square (or circle) met the same fate as the uprising that once filled it. After demonstrators marched to Manana's Pearl Roundabout in March 2011, the Bahraini government retook the circle in a bloody crackdown, then tore up the grass with backhoes and demolished the central Pearl Monument to reassert control.\n![](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/8EhLH7pv14vzBnvhV9a6eVB4vEc=/570x352/media/img/posts/2014/02/RTR2K234/original.jpg)\nIn many ways, France pioneered the conscious use of urban design for political purposes. Paris in the early 19th century was essentially a medieval city, suffocating from overcrowding and poor infrastructure. Baron Haussmann's urban renovations under Napoleon III in the 1850s and 1860s gave the City of Light a modern sewage system, beautiful suburban parks, and a network of train stations. He also took the opportunity to demolish unruly lower-class neighborhoods, banish their impoverished inhabitants to suburbs, and replace their cramped, narrow alleys with spacious, grand boulevards. In the event of an uprising, like those that took place in 1789, 1830, and 1848, French authorities hoped the wider streets would be both harder for revolutionary Parisians to barricade and easier for columns of French soldiers to march through to suppress revolts.\nSimilar calculations are still made today. In 2005, Burma's ruling junta moved the government from Yangon, a sprawling metropolis of 5 million people, to the new inland capital at Naypyidaw for security reasons. Isolated from other population centers, Naypyidaw is populated mostly by government functionaries and military officials who spend as little time as possible in the eerily desolate city. Burmese officials claim almost a million people live there, although the true population is likely far, far lower than that.\nWhen the Saffron Revolution erupted two years later, in 2007, the large-scale protests that rocked other Burmese cities never took hold in Naypyidaw, and the country's military rulers remained in power after a brief but brutal crackdown. Even if the city's population had been large enough for demonstrations, where would they have taken place? Broad boulevards demarcate the specially designated neighborhoods where officials live, with no public square or central space for residents, unruly or otherwise, to congregate. A moat even surrounds the presidential palace. One journalist described the city as \"dictatorship by cartography.\"\n![](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lw0y_AN0Hld1dNdQQQXCOsZsLPY=/570x330/media/img/posts/2014/02/RTR2UOMG/original.jpg)\nKazakhstan's Nursultan Nazarbayev, meanwhile, relocated his seat of power to Astana, a capital deep in the Kazakh steppe filled with futuristic architecture to dazzle visitors. Russian President Vladimir Putin looked to the past for inspiration: In 2008, he revived the Soviet tradition of massive military parades in Moscow's Red Square to project strength. Not blunt enough? Saudi authorities use Riyadh's Deera Square to carry out official public beheadings.\nOthers are more subtle. In Pyongyang, the austere, imposing capital of the world's last totalitarian state, conformity oozes from every hulking mass of concrete. Only the most loyal North Koreans are allowed to reside in the city's many identical apartment blocks, a common characteristic of Stalinist urban design. North Korea's largest city is defined by the \"large monuments of questionable taste [that] dot the cityscape ... linked by absurdly wide Haussmannian boulevards and colossal public squares devoid of an actual public.\" The abundant public space exists solely to glorify the state and the Kim regime's personality cult.\n![](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/pITtQ9mwk5TRP22PbCtK81tUPWA=/570x380/media/img/posts/2014/02/RTR2SHYF/original.jpg)\nIf too much public space can be a bad thing, then China's Tiananmen Square is the worst offender. The world's fourth-largest square can paradoxically be considered \"the opposite of a public space,\" wrote Tim Waterman and Ed Wall in their book on landscape architecture. Tiananmen's \"totalitarian scale dwarfs the individual and forces them to feel subservient to the power of the state. It is a space best suited to parading troops and weaponry, not t o active citizen participation in the daily life of a metropolis.\" The 1989 tank-led suppression of pro-democracy activists occupying the square serves as a stark reminder of how mass demonstrations can fail.\nNot all authoritarians are as adept at urban design. Romanian autocrat Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu's grandiose redesign of Bucharest in the 1980s obliterated one-fifth of the historic city to install a sprawling mess of concrete structures, including the world's largest parliamentary building, which dominates Bucharest's skyline. None of this stopped a massive crowd from turning against him during a speech in Revolution Square in December 1989. Days later, he was captured, convicted, and executed by firing squad.\nIn Cairo today, three years after the fall of Mubarak, the army appears to be pursuing pre-revolution normalcy. Crowds returned to Tahrir Square last summer and demanded the overthrow of Mohammed Morsi, the country's first democratically elected president. He is currently on trial for inciting murder and using violence against protesters, while General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the military leader who overthrew Morsi, is expected to seek the Egyptian presidency. He will probably win.\nTahrir Square is now empty. Workers are busily erecting 10-foot-tall gates, adorned with spikes and painted in Egypt's national colors, around the birthplace of the Egyptian revolution and the epicenter of the Arab Spring. Public squares can be cradles for democratic movements but, to paraphrase Tsiolkovsky, one cannot live in a cradle forever. Will Ukraine's maidan meet a similar fate?",

This kind of community-based art is not currently possible.\nSome of the artworks featured in this timeline address the loss of community we have suffered, and imagine new ways of forming connections.\nWhat memories do you have from pre-Covid life?\nWhat do you miss?\nThank you Philippa Perry for introducing us to saudade, a Portuguese word for the sense of longing you experience for something lost. The feelings of saudade are expressed in the song and music of \u2018fado\u2019.\nWhat do you feel saudade for?\nThe art in this timeline has been created in response to the emotion associated with the pandemic as a means to process and share the experience.\nMarch 2020\nIn March we were all faced with a new reality.\n![](https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024,h_682/https://www.theartofmedicine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/saype-1024x682.jpeg)\nFrench artist Saype says his new work was inspired by COVID 19 and \u2018evokes the building of a world with more solidarity and more humanity\u2019. The fresco covers more than 3,000 square feet in the Swiss Alps.\nWhat thoughts and feelings does this image evoke in you?\nApril 2020\nThroughout April every Thursday night people took to the streets to clap for the NHS, images of the NHS appeared in street art, and people posted pictures of rainbows to represent the NHS.\n![](https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_640,h_435/https://www.theartofmedicine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pontefract-street-art.jpg)\n![](https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_700,h_467/https://www.theartofmedicine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bergamo-mural.jpg)\nThis mural reads: \u2018To All Of You\u2026 Thank You!\u2019\nWhat sense do you make of these public displays of thanks?\nMay 2020\nBored of lockdown people started baking bread, gardening and being very imaginative.

Might your response have changed over the period of the pandemic?\nGrayson Perry started his C4 Art Club showcasing art created by members of the public, inspired by the Pandemic. You can watch all the episodes and the 2021 new series on All4 Grayson\u2019s Art Club.\nThis is an initiative for people to get into something creative over lockdown. Have you tried (or considered trying) anything new over lockdown?\nJune 2020\nBy June 2020 communicating with work colleagues, family and friends remotely had become the new norm.\nMany of us have found navigating Zoom and similar platforms challenging, tiring and confusing, as well as exciting, fun and rewarding with the phrase \u2018you\u2019re muted\u2019 beginning every conversation.\nWhat do you think of this collection of thoughts about Zoom by @stephen_collins?\nHave you come across any of these figures in your experience of video calls?\nWhat were your initial thoughts about remote communication, and how do you feel now about it?\n![](https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_769,h_1024/https://www.theartofmedicine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/collins-769x1024.png)\nIf you would like to think more about connecting remotely take a look at one of E.M. Forster\u2019s short stories. Written in 1909, 110 years before the COVID-19 pandemic, The Machine Stops describes a technology very similar to Zoom.\n\u2026 the round plate that she held in her hands began to glow. A faint blue light shot across it, darkening to purple, and presently she could see the image of her son, who lived on the other side of the earth, and he could see her.\nIt\u2019s amazing how E M Forster could imagine the future and show it to us through his story.\nJuly 2020\nIt\u2019s ha rd to recall what actually happened in July with any degree of accuracy. Some aspects of life returned temporarily to a more normal feel with non-essential shops and hairdressers opening up, but some areas of the country faced a continued lockdown.\n![](https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_891,h_1024/https://www.theartofmedicine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/93794413_3501029386580972_6867415320169256978_n-891x1024.jpg)\nWhat do you see in this image?\nBrazin\u2019s piece perhaps captures the surreal, claustrophobic feeling of lockdown.

When galleries, theatres, cinemas, and other arts venues closed, many artists lost their livelihoods. The Artists Walk provided a new outlet for artists to share their work with local residents.\nHave you missed having access to art?\nWhat are you most looking forward to doing when lockdown eases, and why?\nDecember 2020\n![](https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_860,h_484/https://www.theartofmedicine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/living-words.jpg)\nThe UK-wide dementia charity Living Words created \u2018Bringing The Inside Out\u2019 from the testimonies of care home residents with dementia, their carers and their relatives.

The creation was revealed to celebrate the announcement that 10 million doses of the vaccine have been given in the UK: \u2018I\u2019m hoping this artwork, which is a very beautiful thing, will spur more people on to want to get vaccinated.\u2019\nIt is 34cm in diameter, making it a million times bigger than the actual nanoparticle in the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nJanuary 2021\nHowever, the positive vaccine news was overshadowed by a steep rise in COVID 19 cases bringing with it a dramatic increase in the number of deaths. It was reported that infections had increased by 50% from early December and that 1 in 63 people had been infected. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that these findings \u2018will have a knock-on effect on the already significant pressures faced by our NHS and hospitals\u2019.\nThis cartoon was shared on Twitter, the artist is unknown.\nHow does this image make you feel?\nHow might the patient in the image be feeling? What about the doctor?\nFebruary 2021\nStuck back in lockdown with dark evenings, snow and flooding  in some parts of the UK.\nPeople were once again encouraged to use their creativity.\nOne family have been entertaining thousands on YouTube wit their clever adaptation of familiar songs.\nThe song is a parody of Total Eclipse of the Heart, it contains some familiar realities of Third Lockdown:\nOnce upon a time, we could travel abroad, now we barely get in the car\u2026\nOnce upon a time we went hiking for miles, But now we can\u2019t be arsed with the park\u2026\nThere\u2019s nothing to do, we\u2019re totally fixed where we are.\nHow does this Third Lockdown compare to previous moments of the pandemic?\nLaunched by Antony Gormley, the Great Big Art Exhibition encouraged Brits to get creative and then display their lockdown artwork, creating the nation\u2019s largest-ever exhibition which will run until April.\nAre you involved?\n[caption id=\"attachment_3743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]\nGreat Big Art Exhibition\nMarch 2021\nOne year on.\nWe continue to live with the fear of COVID 19, and the change this brings to our lives, hopes and aspirations.\nFor some, the scars are deep and the change permanent.\nThe lived experience of COVID 19 is captured perfectly by Michel Rosen in his poem Many Different Kinds of Love: Life, Death, and the NHS (published by Ebury)\nHere is an excerpt.\nGoing Home\nI\u2019m a traveller\nwho reached\nthe Land of the Dead.\nI broke the rule that said I had to stay.\nI crossed back over the water,\nI dodged the guard dog,\nI came out.\nI\u2019ve returned.\nI wander about.\nI left some things down there.\nIt took bits of me as prisoner:\nan ear and an eye.\nThey\u2019re waiting for me to come back.\nThe ear is listening.\nThe eye is the lookout.\nTwo physios come over.\nThey ask me to walk across the room.\nThey say that\u2019s very good.\nThey ask me to push my legs against their hands.\nThey say that\u2019s very good.\nOne of them asks me what are\nmy longterm objectives.\nI stop and think.\nWhat are my longterm objectives?\nDo I have longterm objectives?\nShould I have longterm objectives?\nI would like to write a book\nabout a French dog called Gaston le Dog.\nI don\u2019t say that.\nI say that I would like to\nbe able to walk to the Jewish deli on the corner\nand wheel the shopping back\nin our trolley.\nThe physio smiles.\nShe writes it down in her book.\nI\u2019m trying to say that going shopping\nand bringing it back\nseems huge,\nmuch bigger than anything I can do now.\nIt feels like a longterm objective.\nAnything else? she says.\nLive for a bit more? I think,\nand I\u2019ve never bothered to pickle cucumbers,\nI just buy them,\nbut my mother made lovely pickled cucumbers,\nI would like to try that one day.\nYou\u2019re doing very well, they say.\nI am not who I was.\nI am who I was.\nThis is not me.\nThis is me.\nI am now the person\nwho had Covid:\nthe thing that came in March\nI am now the person\nwho disappeared\nin April and May\nI am now the person\nwho peers into the mirror\nhoping his left eye\nwill see what the right eye sees,\ncatching a glimpse of the blackness\nof the big pupil\nlooking back at me in hope.\nI am now the person\nwho hears the telephonic trebly sound\nthrough the hearing aid\nin his left ear,\nthat makes the sound of a kettle boiling\ninto scream.\nI am now the person\nwho is alert to every twinge\nor mark anywhere on me.\nI am getting to know this person.\nThis is not me\nThis is me\nWe hope that this collection of art has helped you to reflect on a year of life during the pandemic. Maybe it has inspired you to make your own collection or pick up a paintbrush or pencil and create your own response to the COVID 19.\nPage created by Nicola Gill & Beth Jakeman March 2021",

        "description": "The image of a Nazi flag is in fact two months old and was shot at a flea market in Pennsylvania.",
        "text": "A photo shared thousands of times on Twitter and claimed to be from a November 14, 2020 rally in Washington, DC to support President Donald Trump after his election defeat is in fact a two-month old image from a flea market in Pennsylvania.\n\"So the Million Maga March isn't even a #MillionMoronMarch....It's a few hundred extremists and Proud Boys, and a few \"entrepreneurs\" selling fascist/racist gear.....\" says a November 14, 2020 tweet that shared the photo and was liked more than 2,000 times.\nA screenshot of a tweet posted on November 14, 2020\nThe image shows a man next to a vehicle and what looks like a stall displaying merchandise including various flags. A Confederate battle flag can be seen on the far right of the image, next to the \"thin blue line\" flag in support of law enforcement, as well as a Nazi flag on the left.\nSimilar claims can be found on Twitter -- here, here, and here -- and Facebook, here, here and here.\nAlso Read: Did Dead People Cast Vote In Georgia As Claimed By Trump Campaign?\nBut the photo of the stall was not taken in the nation's capital at the rally by thousands of Trump supporters, who received a drive-past from the president's motorcade before he headed to his golf club.\nAFP Fact Check found through a reverse image search that the photo is a couple of months old, taken at a flea market in Pennsylvania.\nThe photo was originally posted in a tweet on September 5, 2020. \"These images make me sick. At a flea market hosted by the Braddock Inn in Farmington, PA a vendor is selling nazi stamps and a large swastika is displayed,\" Sam Vinograd, CNN national security analyst, wrote on Twitter.\nA screenshot of a tweet with the original photo posted on September 5, 2020\nThe flea market incident was also reported in local news, here -- where the same stall is seen in a photo from a different angle.\nThe pro-Trump gathering sparked conversations on social media between anti-Trump and pro-Trump groups, one week after Joe Biden's projected win in the 2020 presidential race. The hashtags #MarchForTrump and #MAGAMillionMarch were trending on Twitter, while #MillionMoronMarch was used to oppose the rally.\nTrump supporters, some of them draped in American flags and other patriotic gear, waved blue \"Trump 2020\" flags and others including the \"thin blue line\" banner. They shouted \"We love Trump,\" and \"Stop the steal,\" in reference to claims of mass electoral fraud falsely made by Donald Trump.\nWith right-wing group the Proud Boys also attending, a large security presence was deployed to prevent clashes with anti-Trump events in the city. There were a number of scuffles and 10 arrests, but no major violence had been reported.\nAFP did not report any sightings of the Nazi flag at the rally.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by BOOM staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The report said that the herders tearfully said goodbye to the animals.\nAs the correspondent learned, heavy rains are still falling in this area, but the herders have not left the pigs in trouble and are engaged in rescue operations. In addition, it became known that we are talking about 3,000 heads, not 6,000.\nLi Kai, director of the Epidemic Protection Center at the Luan Veterinary Administration, told the reporter that many measures were taken to save the pigs: breeding animals were moved to pens located at a higher level, pigs weighing more than 80 kg were removed and stabbed, and pigs weighing less than 80 kg were transported to another pigsty.",

The moment the First World War ended, the Second was on the horizon. Women worked to prevent war through peace efforts, while others worked to rearm, rebuild, and prepare for revenge. When war finally reared its head, women again served their nations at unprecedented scales, building on the role they played in the first war. From Japan, to the US, to India, to Europe and North Africa, women everywhere were drawn into the conflict.\nWomen served in war as they had before, but this time in greater numbers and with even more access to the front. Women served behind the lines, worked in the resistance, fought as soldiers and pilots, and were victims of war. Everywhere the war touched, women were also victims and surviors of sexual assault and rape. Trigger warning: this chapter will discuss the rape of women in war. While it is hard to talk about, it is important to understand the particularly vulnerable positions civilians are in during war and to understand it on a human level so that history does not repeat itself. World War II is a dark subject for everyone, including women.\nPacifism\nIn Europe, World War II was building the moment World War I ended. A major cause of the war was the resolution to the first, in which British and French governments sought to punish Germany by placing heaving payments, seizing German colonies, and pushing back German boundaries. The Treaty of Versailles forced German people into poverty while the Kaiser and his family lived in relative luxury. It installed a weak and unpopular democratic government and built resentment in the German people.\nPacifist women who had begun their efforts in World War I worked tirelessly in the two decades between the wars to prevent the next. In 1919, the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace changed its name to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) and relocated its central office to Geneva, near the League of Nations. Between the wars American Emily Greene Balch, a former Welsley Professor of Economics, became the leader and worked without pay to the organization's ends. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1946 for her work to promote peace and reconciliation.\nIn the years between the wars, French pacifist Jeanne M\u00e9lin, who had been active in World War I moved toward a more radical pacifism. Her goal was to prevent war and international cooperation in order to democratically resolve issues. M\u00e9lin became active in international relations, exchanging almost 1,000 letters with like minded women from around the world including: Gabrielle Duch\u00eane, Louise Bodin, Jane Addams, Chrystal MacMillan, and even German leaders: Gertrud Baer and Lida Gustava Heymann.\nThe peace organization (Ligue international des femmes pour la paix et la libert\u00e9 or LIFPL) to which M\u00e9lin belonged, was seen by people at the time as a distraction from the hard issues of the time or worse, the product of the weaker sex, but their efforts would have lasting impacts beyond the war, laying the groundwork for the international cooperation that followed. M\u00e9lin refused to accept the Treaty of Versailles, and particularly the theory of German culpability. She increased her symbolic and media-related activities in support of Franco-German reconciliation. At a peace conference in Zurich in 1919, she is remembered for shaking the hand of the German delegate Lida Gustava Heymann. In her speech, she refused to condone France humiliating Germany by way of the peace treaties. She proclaimed herself a sister of these women who, like herself, had fought so strongly against imperialism and militarism. M\u00e9lin traveled widely in Europe on behalf of the LIFPL.\nWomen Peace activists were widely engaged during this period, but were often operating outside positions of power and many countries were taking the position of neutrality rather than actions that could potentially avoid war, which made peace initiatives difficult, if not impossible. In 1922, a delegation from the Messag\u00e8res de la Paix, comprising Jane Addams, Catherine Marshall, and Jeanne M\u00e9lin, won the support of the Scandinavian countries against French occupation of former German territories. Unfortunately, because those countries had declared neutrality, they were unable to take any steps that would put pressure on France. And since they operated outside of power, the almost entirely male French and British governments refused to receive them. When the women proposed reasonable changes to the League of Nation\u2019s constitution, which would improve cooperation, they were ignored. Other women\u2019s peace groups wanted the League of Nations to be replaced by an international society of nations advocating sex equality, the ec onomic independence of women, the equal sharing of wealth and respect for minorities.\nThe international feminist pacifist movement was really active in the mid-1920s hosting conferences to dispel myths propagated by national governments. Jeanne M\u00e9lin took part in a parade for peace on Armistice Day (the day peace was established in World War I) in 1931. The march brought together 19 different societies working for peace, crossed Paris by bus, and was marked by two symbolic arrests, one at the Etoile on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier and another at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.\nAs things heated up and tensions were mounting in Europe, these women peace activists showed just how far ahead of their time they were. Jeanne M\u00e9lin sent a manifesto to the German people proposing a European economic federation, an idea that would not be realized for decades. In 1935 she took part in a number of meetings held by the world committee of Women against War and Fascism, created in 1934 by another French woman, Gabrielle Duch\u00eane. Both were convinced that only a single union of feminists, united by a sense of internationalism, could wage the fight against war. Duch\u00eane continued her work during and after the war. When Nazi\u2019s later invaded France, she was on their list and sought refuge with friends where she helped people escape Europe. After the war she left a momentous archive of documents related to women\u2019s peace and labor union work.\nOf course the second world war did happen. In 1957, in her memoirs, Jeanne M\u00e9lin bears witness to the desperation and isolation she felt when tackling the subject of the declaration of war. She wrote, \u201cWell at this point, I find it impossible to describe my greatest disappointment\u2026 having worked so hard and relentlessly for harmony between nations, for peace and human fraternity, all I could do was stand by impotently as such a worthy ideal collapsed around me\u201d.\nRising Fascism: Germany\nThe Depression in Germany allowed for extremism to breed and gradually the Nazi party under the charismatic leadership of Adolf Hitler came to power. Their goal was to return the Third Reich, or the third master race (following the Romans and the Prussians) to glory, but that process involved eradicating undesirable elements from society through policy and breeding. Women played a significant role in Hitler\u2019s plan to create an ideal society based on the \"Aryan\" race although this role was ultimately the submission of women in an ultra masculine society. Hitler praised German women as loyal and devoted supporters of the Nazi movement. He valued them for their activism and also recognized their biological ability to bear children who would contribute to the growth of the race. The Nazis believed that a larger population of pure Aryans would strengthen Germany militarily and provide settlers for conquered lands in eastern Europe. To promote this goal, the Nazi regime encouraged \"racially pure\" women to have as many children as possible.\nThe National Socialist Women's Union and the German Women's Agency used Nazi propaganda to emphasize the roles of women as wives and mothers. Besides increasing the population, the regime sought to maintain \"racial purity\" by passing laws that prohibited marriage between \"Aryans\" and \"non-Aryans\" and preventing individuals with disabilities or certain diseases from marrying at all. Well, this sounds like Aryan women were praised, and they were, it was entirely for their reproductive function. Outside of that opportunities, for women in the workplace were rapidly closing. Admissions into institutions of higher learning, licensure, and other measures of social value were deteriorating.\nGirls were taught from a young age to embrace their roles as mothers and obedient wives through schools and compulsory membership in the Nazi League of German Girls (Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del; BDM) starting at the age of ten. However, as the Nazis geared up for war, the need for labor forced them to encourage women to enter the workforce. Women were compelled to participate through programs like the Duty Year, which required all women to provide compulsory service, and many even joined the military.\nIn 1936, the Nazis implemented a state-directed program called Lebensborn (Fount of Life), which aimed to increase the population. Under this program, every SS member was expected to father four children, whether they were married or not. Lebensborn homes were more like state endorsed whore houses for racially pure women. They provided support and assistance to these single mothers and their children, including financial aid and assistance in finding adoptive parents for the children.\nThe Lebensborn program did exist but was not aggressively promoted, instead, the Nazi population policy focused more on promoting family and marriage. The state encouraged marriage through loans, provided financial support for each new child, publicly recognized families with many children, awarded the Cross of Honor of the Germa n Mother to women with four or more children, and increased penalties for abortion of desired Aryan babies.\nRising Fascism: Japan\nAcross the world, Japan played a small role in World War I as part of the Allies and in that time continued its militarism and imperial ambitions. As in the Russo-Japanese war, their eyes were set on Manchuria as a start, but their goal, like that of the emerging Nazi\u2019s across the ocean, was nothing short of Asian and Pacific domination.\nPart of this was fueled by a distorted view of the world and gender relations. Imperial Army soldiers were critical of the west and modernization, deemed the West the enemy, and worried about society becoming more feminine. They were encouraged through government propaganda and education to be against the \"new woman,\" the women's movement, women entering male jobs, and modern technology that made life easier for both men and women. Soldiers were expected to prioritize loyalty to the Emperor and the nation, not their families or women, which primary source evidence showed was not easy for them. This idea of military masculinity started to dominate children's mass culture too.\nAt the same time the empire needed women in order to win wars. Women's roles in Japan expanded to support soldiers on the home front, joining women's organizations and performing various duties. The ideals of a \"good wife, wise mother\" were transformed to include national service. Women became crucial in the war effort, providing comfort and support to soldiers. The Women's National Defense Association played a significant role in promoting defense knowledge and aiding families of soldiers. The association's activities included sending care packages and letters to soldiers, as well as visiting their homes. Membership in these associations became compulsory, or forced like the draft, so millions of women participated. Some women were even willing to cross the ideological border between the home front and the front lines. The survey conducted by Occupation forces after the war found that women, especially young women, showed strong fighting spirit.\nThe way that women were idealized at home in Japan could not have been more different from how state agencies treated women in conquered Japanese territory. Especially as the war expanded, the rape and assault of local women by Japanese soldiers became a serious issue for the military and the colonial regime. The increasing number of soldiers with venereal diseases tarnished their reputation and the careers of commanders. The military administration believed that the only way to curb the spread of diseases and maintain soldiers' morale was to establish \u201ccomfort stations\u201d of sexual slavery throughout the empire. The Japanese military recruited Japanese women, sometimes working in prostitution, under different names, such as the Women's Volunteer Corps and the Patriotic Emperor-Approved Corps, often from poor backgrounds or those who believed they were volunteering for regular work. In reality they were sacrificed for the \u201cgood of the nation\u201d in whorehouses on military bases. The system of military sexual slavery became institutionalized as The Comfort Women system. The Japanese forced women primarily from South Korea, but also China, the Philippines and other areas under their control into sexual slavery across the Pacific.\nOne of most horrific assaults on foreign Asian women came between 1937-1938 during an event known as the Rape of Nanjing. The massacre in Nanjing by the Japanese army resulted in the brutal killing of entire Chines families. The city was left strewn with bodies for months as the Japanese aimed to completely destroy it. Alongside the mass killings, tens of thousands of women, including young girls and elderly women, endured horrifying acts of rape and torture. Eyewitness accounts and subsequent analyses indicate that between 20,000 and 80,000 women suffered brutal sexual assaults, with many of them being mutilated and killed after the attacks, including victims of gang rapes.\nThe exact death toll of the Nanjing Massacre remains uncertain, with estimates ranging from 200,000 to 300,000 people. Following the war, both General Matsui and Lieutenant Tani Hisao were tried and convicted for war crimes by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, leading to their subsequent executions.\nWomen served in war as they had before, but this time in greater numbers and with even more access to the front. Women served behind the lines, worked in the resistance, fought as soldiers and pilots, and were victims of war. Everywhere the war touched, women were also victims and surviors of sexual assault and rape. Trigger warning: this chapter will discuss the rape of women in war. While it is hard to talk about, it is important to understand the particularly vulnerable positions civilians are in during war and to understand it on a human level so that history does not repeat itself. World War II is a dark subject for everyone , including women.\nPacifism\nIn Europe, World War II was building the moment World War I ended. A major cause of the war was the resolution to the first, in which British and French governments sought to punish Germany by placing heaving payments, seizing German colonies, and pushing back German boundaries. The Treaty of Versailles forced German people into poverty while the Kaiser and his family lived in relative luxury. It installed a weak and unpopular democratic government and built resentment in the German people.\nPacifist women who had begun their efforts in World War I worked tirelessly in the two decades between the wars to prevent the next. In 1919, the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace changed its name to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) and relocated its central office to Geneva, near the League of Nations. Between the wars American Emily Greene Balch, a former Welsley Professor of Economics, became the leader and worked without pay to the organization's ends. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1946 for her work to promote peace and reconciliation.\nIn the years between the wars, French pacifist Jeanne M\u00e9lin, who had been active in World War I moved toward a more radical pacifism. Her goal was to prevent war and international cooperation in order to democratically resolve issues. M\u00e9lin became active in international relations, exchanging almost 1,000 letters with like minded women from around the world including: Gabrielle Duch\u00eane, Louise Bodin, Jane Addams, Chrystal MacMillan, and even German leaders: Gertrud Baer and Lida Gustava Heymann.\nThe peace organization (Ligue international des femmes pour la paix et la libert\u00e9 or LIFPL) to which M\u00e9lin belonged, was seen by people at the time as a distraction from the hard issues of the time or worse, the product of the weaker sex, but their efforts would have lasting impacts beyond the war, laying the groundwork for the international cooperation that followed. M\u00e9lin refused to accept the Treaty of Versailles, and particularly the theory of German culpability. She increased her symbolic and media-related activities in support of Franco-German reconciliation. At a peace conference in Zurich in 1919, she is remembered for shaking the hand of the German delegate Lida Gustava Heymann. In her speech, she refused to condone France humiliating Germany by way of the peace treaties. She proclaimed herself a sister of these women who, like herself, had fought so strongly against imperialism and militarism. M\u00e9lin traveled widely in Europe on behalf of the LIFPL.\nWomen Peace activists were widely engaged during this period, but were often operating outside positions of power and many countries were taking the position of neutrality rather than actions that could potentially avoid war, which made peace initiatives difficult, if not impossible. In 1922, a delegation from the Messag\u00e8res de la Paix, comprising Jane Addams, Catherine Marshall, and Jeanne M\u00e9lin, won the support of the Scandinavian countries against French occupation of former German territories. Unfortunately, because those countries had declared neutrality, they were unable to take any steps that would put pressure on France. And since they operated outside of power, the almost entirely male French and British governments refused to receive them. When the women proposed reasonable changes to the League of Nation\u2019s constitution, which would improve cooperation, they were ignored. Other women\u2019s peace groups wanted the League of Nations to be replaced by an international society of nations advocating sex equality, the economic independence of women, the equal sharing of wealth and respect for minorities.\nThe international feminist pacifist movement was really active in the mid-1920s hosting conferences to dispel myths propagated by national governments. Jeanne M\u00e9lin took part in a parade for peace on Armistice Day (the day peace was established in World War I) in 1931. The march brought together 19 different societies working for peace, crossed Paris by bus, and was marked by two symbolic arrests, one at the Etoile on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier and another at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.\nAs things heated up and tensions were mounting in Europe, these women peace activists showed just how far ahead of their time they were. Jeanne M\u00e9lin sent a manifesto to the German people proposing a European economic federation, an idea that would not be realized for decades. In 1935 she took part in a number of meetings held by the world committee of Women against War and Fascism, created in 1934 by another French woman, Gabrielle Duch\u00eane. Both were convinced that only a single union of feminists, united by a sense of internationalism, could wage the fight against war. Duch\u00eane continued her work during and after the war. When Nazi\u2019s later invaded France, she was on their list and sought refuge with friends where she helped people escape Europe. After the war she lef t a momentous archive of documents related to women\u2019s peace and labor union work.\nOf course the second world war did happen.

Valuing their roles as mothers who are believed to reproduce a particular kind of nation, and little else, reduced women living under these regimes to brood mares. Therefore, women feminists were targets of fascist regimes. Feminists who had come to support contraception and abortion for women\u2019s bodily autonomy and freedom were a particular target.\nFascist nations under Hitler, Hirohito, and Mussolini played a significant role in controlling women's bodily autonomy by implementing measures such as restricting access to reproductive healthcare and providing incentives for increased reproduction, including financial rewards for having lots of children. In 1930, the Rocco Code was implemented in Italy, which banned abortion and limited women's access to birth control. This law also targeted midwives as a source of information on contraception and abortion services. Women's fertility was treated as a public good owned by the state.\nIn Nazi Germany, the Nuremberg laws imposed racist distinctions on when abortion is illegal. There were harsher punishments for abortions performed on women classified as Aryan, while abortions on Jewish and other minority groups were encouraged for eugenic reasons. When the Nazi\u2019s took over France they imposed a puppet government known as the Vichy regime. There, abortion was declared a crime against the state in 1942. This law led to the imprisonment of Eug\u00e8ne Humbert and the execution by guillotine of Marie-Louise Giraud in 1943 for being abortion providers.\nWomen found various ways to collectively push back against the political assault on their bodies. Some pregnant women concealed their pregnancies from employers to avoid restrictive work laws, while others share d recipes containing folk medicine and reproductive health information, expanding access to such knowledge. Rice weeders expressed their resistance through work songs, discussing their struggles and aspirations for personal rights in opposition to the state's agenda.\nMidwives even engaged in clandestine actions, stealing forbidden tools to perform private abortions and deliveries. Using women\u2019s bodies and reproductive potential for the good of the state supported the fascist ideas of hierarchies. They viewed their race as superior to other races and aimed to prove that through military might. Women, although part of that race were subjected internally to the gender hierarchy which was male defined and dominated.\nUSSR\nBy the 1930s, the Soviet approach to communism was in full swing. Lenin had been replaced by Stalin, and an even harsher version of communism was in place. Ironically, while the USSR violated human rights, it also established greater gender equity in the workforce. The Bolsheviks earlier had sought to transform the family by giving men and women equal rights. Lenin stated \u201c\u201c[The woman] continues to be a domestic slave, because petty housework crushes, strangles, stultifies and degrades her, chains her to the kitchen and the nursery, and she wastes her labor on barbarously unproductive, petty, nerve-racking, stultifying and crushing drudgery.\u201d Stalin continued some of the commitment to women\u2019s rights: the army contained all-female units, and the 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union stated that \u201cWomen in the USSR are accorded equal rights with men in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social, and political life.\u201d However in practice, Stalin\u2019s Russia did not live up to those goals: women continued to bear the burden of childcare and during the war the ideology of women as \u201cheroines of the home\u201d was inculcated.\nWhile western powers ignored the hostile and expanding fascist states, they also appeared to be blind to Soviet behaviors. In the 1930s, Stalin began imprisoning resistors, mostly men, to the communist regime and sending them to the Gulags, work camps in Siberia. This dislocation, disappearance, and often murder of men left many towns within the Soviet union with a female majority and families run by female matriarchs trying to pick up the pieces. Stalin committed a mass murder known as the Holodomor, which resulted from forced collectivization policies and which caused the deaths of millions, including Ukrainians. Women, deprived on male partners by the Soviets, suffered immeasurable pain and suffering as they struggled to feed their families and save their children in the midst of mass hunger.

Examples include the Rape of Nanjing mentioned above, the Rape of Berlin, in which the Russian army raped virtually every woman left in Berlin at the end of the war, rapes and sexual torture in the Holocaust, the sexual slavery of the Comfort Woman system, rapes by Allied soldiers across Europe, and the extensive rape of Ethiopian women by the invading Italian army.\nWhen Italian men marched into Ethiopia in 1936 before the western world was ready to consider the start of World War II, they marched to songs about the sexual things they would do to Ethiopian women when they arrived. Seeing the rape of women as a right of war, indeed perhaps as a male military \u201crite of passage\u201d has been pervasive in many wars. This was bolstered by the fact that Italian fascism supported gender hierarchy with women subordinate to men.. For Ethiopian women, fighting in WWII was a necessity. Many took up arms to defend their homeland.\nThe war brought about widespread violence, and Ethiopian women were not spared from its effects. There were documented cases of sexual assault and rape committed by Italian forces against Ethiopian women. These acts of violence had a traumatic and long-lasting impact on the survivors, leaving deep scars on both individual and collective levels.\nEthiopian women actively participated in the resistance against Italian occupation. They played crucial roles in supporting the Ethiopian resistance forces, providing food, shelter, and medical assistance to fighters. Women also acted as messengers, spies, and nurses during the war, making significant contributions to the resistance efforts.\nEthiopian leaders asked Britain and France for support, but they were denied. They warned that the war that was happening in North Africa would soon be in Europe, but leaders were so fearful of another global war they still refused to join the war. The delayed involvement of both the Americans and the British had a profound impact on the lives of women around the world. Whenever an army is invading, there is great risk to the civilian population who are often left behind when the trained men head off to distant front lines.\nOutbreak of War\nThe Italians re-attacked Ethiopia in 1936, which was the only African nation not colonized by Europe. The Japanese, seeking to expand influence, invaded Manchuria in 1931, and followed this with a formal invasion of China in 1937. The Nazi\u2019s, meanwhile, annexed central European states in the mid-1930s. Western h istorians, however, point to the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 as the start. The United States did not join until Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in late 1940, almost a decade after Japanese violence began the war in Asia.\nThe Axis powers ran rampant in the early years of the war. Germany quickly overwhelmed much of Western Europe. After signing a nonaggression pact with the Soviet union, Germany invaded Poland from one side, while the Soviets invaded from the other, they turned their eyes on Norway, then they stabbed the Soviets in the back driving deep into Soviet territory. Japan similarly went wild in Korea, Manchuria, China, and Vietnam. Italy went after an old rivalry with Ethiopia, before expanding the war into other parts of North Africa. Each of these nations had superior weaponry, improved military tactics, and the desire for revenge from World War I.\nWorld War Two saw extensive use of rape both as a tactic of war and as a casual expression of misogyny.

Germany quickly overwhelmed much of Western Europe. After signing a nonaggression pact with the Soviet union, Germany invaded Poland from one side, while the Soviets invaded from the other, they turned their eyes on Norway, then they stabbed the Soviets in the back driving deep into Soviet territory. Japan similarly went wild in Korea, Manchuria, China, and Vietnam. Italy went after an old rivalry with Ethiopia, before expanding the war into other parts of North Africa. Each of these nations had superior weaponry, improved military tactics, and the desire for revenge from World War I.\n![Picture](/uploads/1/5/3/1/15313606/published/561919d39dd7cc02308b5837.webp?1722798515)\nReinstating Women\nWhen the war erupted, women again found themselves thrust into the fight as they had been in World War I. Nations scrambled to reinstate closed branches of women\u2019s service and get the home front firing at all cylinders. Yet again, millions of women took on the monumental task of nursing the millions of wounded and ill soldiers in thousands of field and local hospitals. They also charged headfirst into the factories. Even the future Queen Elizabeth II, a teenager at the time, became a mechanic during the war.\nThe sheer scale of this war meant that each country in volved was throwing their full voluntary forces\u2019 weight at one another, and most also had to draft men to ensure they could protect themselves from or overcome their enemies. As a result, women of both Axis and Allied countries were needed in the military. This meant that more women were allowed into divisions of the military to take on clerical roles, serve as drivers, mechanics, welders, pilots, plumbers, electricians, and more. While in most cases the military brass basically wrote this off as a necessary measure in order to free men up for the battlefield, it became another opportunity for women around the world to prove themselves in fields typically off-limits to them.\nAs with World War I, women in most countries were meant to be far from the \u201caction,\u201d though many found themselves there anyway, as they were formed into women\u2019s divisions of various military branches. For example, the British had the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). Other nations had variations on the same branches of service.\nDuring World War II, the Women's Land Army (WLA) played a crucial role in increasing Britain's food production. Prior to the war, Britain relied heavily on imported food. However, the outbreak of war necessitated the cultivation of more land and the production of food domestically. As many male agricultural workers joined the military, women were called upon to form a new workforce in rural areas. Initially, women were asked to volunteer for service in the Land Army. At its highest point in 1944, the WLA comprised over 80,000 women, commonly referred to as \"land girls.\" Land girls took on a wide range of tasks on the land, enduring various weather conditions and working in different parts of the country as directed. They played an essential role in supporting agricultural activities and boosting food production during the war.\nIt was Soviet women who had the biggest combat presence. Much like in World War I, but to a much larger degree, Soviet women were accepted into combat roles. In part, this was due to the social equality aspects of the communist government. Another crucial factor in Soviet use of women in war was how devastating World War I had been to their population. Russia lost more people than any other nation combined. There simply weren\u2019t enough people to fight a war of this magnitude again without women.\nAn astonishing 800,000 Russian women would serve in the military during WWII. Not to mention that midway through the war every Russian nurse, half of their doctors and surgeons, and nearly half of their paramedics would be women. 200,000 would be decorated during the war, and 89 would win the Hero of the Soviet Union award, which is the equivalent of the Medal of Honor. This doesn\u2019t even include the women who served in resistance groups behind enemy lines!\nWomen served in infantry positions, as machine gunners, tank drivers, operated anti-aircraft batteries, and more. Some women showed a real proficiency for war, like Lyudmila Pavlichenko who was one of just over 2,000 Soviet snipers. She earned the nickname \u201cLady Death\u201d with 309 kills. She became such a symbol of Soviet power that after an injury in the field she was forcefully retired because the Soviet leadership thought that she provided too much positive morale to lose her. Instead, she became a propaganda tool throughout Russia, and was shipped off to America, Canada, and Britain to convince the powers that be to open up a second front in France. When asked by an American reporter why and how she could do this job, she stated quite succinctly, \u201cEvery German who remains alive will kill women, children and old folks [...] Dead Germans are harmless. Therefore, if I kill a German, I am saving lives.\u201d In the end, her time of killing was over, but she would return to train the next generation of snipers. Female pilots, much as they were viewed in other parts of the world, were not considered likely to have a major impact on the war, and thus were given inferior equipment and certainly given inferior respect.\nRussia\u2019s female fighter pilots had earned their stripes, claiming the only two female fighter aces, but it was their night bombers of the 588th Regiment that claim the real fame. Known as the Night Witches, most were women in their late teens and twenties, including Nadezhda Vasiliyevna Popova who joined the war because her brother was killed in battle. She said, \u201cI saw the German aircraft flying along our roads filled with people who were leaving their homes, firing at them with their machine guns [...] Seeing this gave me feelings inside that made me want to fight them.\u201d\nThese women were more than willing to fight, but were given, quite literally, the bottom of the barrel for equipment. They got rickety crop dusters that were not considered likely to stand up to any anti-aircraft fire if challenged, had a top speed that was unbearably slow, and no modern techn ology to speak of. No, these death machines just had a badass pilot and navigator, two small bombs, and just enough fuel to get to the target and back. Hell, they didn\u2019t even get parachutes! Yet, this all-female regiment, from their commanders to their pilots, to their navigators, and even their mechanics, flew nearly 25,000 combat sorties and damaged millions of dollars\u2019 worth of supplies, transportation networks, communication systems, and fuel depots. They were exposed to the elements in the open plane, they were exposed to enemy fire that tore some planes to pieces, and saw 32 of their crew lost to the war, but they also claimed 23 of the total 89 Hero of the Soviet Union titles awarded to women.\nWhen the war erupted, women again found themselves thrust into the fight as they had been in World War I.

Left behind were women, children, and elderly people. It was predominantly women who made up the resistance efforts in these places. In Poland, women acted as couriers, delivering information to the ghettos. Many women sought refuge in the forests of eastern Poland and the Soviet Union, where they joined armed partisan units.\nWomen also made significant contributions to the French Resistance efforts. One notable example is Sophie Scholl, a student at the University of Munich and member of the White Rose resistance group, who was arrested and executed for distributing anti-Nazi leaflets.\nVirginia d'Albert Lake, an American who married a Frenchman, was active on the Comet Line, which helped downed Allied pilots get to independent Spain from inside occupied France. Together with her husband Philippe, she assisted 67 airmen in evading capture by the Germans through the Comet Escape Line. The d'Albert Lakes used their country house and connections to provide safe houses for escaping airmen, offering them shelter and assistance. Virginia's primary responsibility was meeting these airmen in Paris train stations and housing them until they could continue their journey towards Spain. As Allied bombings disrupted transportation, the couple shifted their focus to sheltering airmen in the Fr\u00e9teval forest.\nHowever, on June 12, 1944, Virginia was spotted by the Gestapo. She was carrying a list of contacts in Ch\u00e2teaudun, which she tore up and swallowed to protect her network. She was imprisoned initially near Paris and later sent to Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp and other camps. Despite her challenging circumstances, Virginia's treatment was somewhat better than other prisoners due to her nationality. She worked in the prison kitchen and experienced improved conditions as the war neared its end.\nAdditionally, many women actively engaged in aiding and rescuing Jews in German-occupied Europe. Noteworthy individuals include Jewish parachutist Hannah Szenes, who conducted a daring mission by parachuting into Hungary, and Zionist activist Gisi Fleischmann, who led the Working Group within the Jewish council in Bratislava, attempting to halt the deportations of Jews from Slovakia.\nAlthough a minority, some Catholic nuns heroically saved hundreds of Jewish children during the war. The \"free zone\" in the southern part of France did not uphold its name as it failed to provide safety for Jews. The Vichy government enacted anti-Jewish laws, permitted the internment of Jews from Baden and Alsace Lorraine within its territory, and confiscated Jewish possessions, just like the Nazis.\nOn August 23, 1942, Archbishop Jules-Geraud Sali\u00e8ge of Toulouse urged his clergy to support Jews and that Jews were part of the human race and that a Christian should not for get this fact. Sali\u00e8ge was one of the few voices of protest against the Vichy authorities' policies. Sister Denise Bergon, the young mother superior of the Convent of Notre Dame de Massip, located northeast of Toulouse, was deeply moved by Sali\u00e8ge's message. She saw it as a call to action that transcended religious, racial, and political boundaries. At her convent, she took in Jewish children who were hiding from the intensifying round-ups of Jews carried out by German troops and, later, by the Milice fascist militia. By winter 1942, the number of Jewish children seeking refuge within the convent grew to 83. Sister Denise, with the support of the Resistance, ensured their safety through various means, including hiding them in secret locations within the convent.\nThe children were sheltered amidst constant danger, with Sister Denise and her fellow nuns going to great lengths to protect them. Despite the risks, the convent managed to keep the children hidden and provide for them. Sister Denise's dedication and bravery allowed the Jewish children to survive the war, even though many of their family members were not as fortunate.\nIn Poland, across over 200 religious institutions, nearly 1200 Jewish children were sheltered from the Nazi regime by Catholic nuns. The Danish people helped nearly their entire Jewish population to escape the country under the nose of Nazi occupation. When Mrs. Aage Bertelsen was asked by the Nazi occupiers if she had helped in the operation she unapologetically said, \u201cOf course [...] All decent people did.

Women faced brutal treatment in ghettos and concentration camps, with some forms of persecution specifically aimed at women. What started as oppressive systems that stripped people of their teaching, law, medical, and other licenses and forced them to surrender their businesses and homes to the state turned into the \u201cFinal Solution,\u201d whereby the Nazi\u2019s built gas chambers to execute \u201cundesirable\u201d populations in mass.\nPerhaps the most well known woman from the Holocaust was a girl: Anne Frank. Frank was a Jewish girl who gained international recognition posthumously when her father published her diary, which she wrote while in hiding during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in World War II. Tragically, in August 1944, the hiding place was discovered by the Nazis, and the occupants, including Anne and her family, were arrested. Anne and her sister Margot were eventually transported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they both died of typhus in early 1945, just a few weeks before the camp's liberation.\nGerman authorities subjected women to forced labor, sterilization experiments, beatings, rape, and other forms of abuse. Women formed mutual assistance groups to survive, and some participated in resistance activities against the Nazis. Haika Grosman, for instance, played a pivotal role as one of the organizers of the Bialystok ghetto underground and participated in the Bialystok ghetto revolt. Several Jewish women supplied the gunpowder used by Jewish resistors to detonate a gas chamber during a 1944 uprising, resulting in the deaths of several SS men.\nCertain camps were designated for female prisoners, such as Ravensbr\u00fcck. Most of the prisoners there, around 5,000 women, were considered \u201casocial\u201d: homeless women, \u201ccriminals,\u201d and poor women who had taken up prostitution to survive the war. Anyone suspected of having a venereal disease, or sexually transmitted disease, could end up at Ravensbruck for being a sexworker. There women were subjected to medical experiments by Nazi doctors that were supposed to help the war effort by uncovering treatments for German soldiers like hypothermia, infections, and more. These experiments were performed without the patients consent and were a form of torture for the women who endured them. In the years after the war, many Nazi leaders tried to claim that they were just following orders, but in Oberheuser\u2019s case, there is little evidence of this as orders were scarce, and in many cases direct orders were modified by Nazi staff at the camp.\nHerta Oberheuser worked at Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp. She voluntarily went to work at Ravensbr\u00fcck to advance her career and improve her financial situation. She obtained her medical degree in 1937 and specialized in dermatology. Responding to a newspaper advertisement, Oberheuser joined Ravensbr\u00fcck in 1940, considering it her \"life's work.\" Oberheuser enthusiastically performed these cruel experiments on the female prisoners.\nOberheuser conducted humiliating gynecological examinations as the women arrived at Ravensbruck. Pregnancy checks were part of the examinations conducted at Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp. Many prisoners arrived at the camp already pregnant. In the early years, they were sent to give birth in a nearby town, while their babies were forcibly removed from them and placed in children's homes to be raised by Aryan families. However, starting from 1942, babies were born in Ravensbr\u00fcck but were mostly killed shortly after birth. Forced  abortions were also performed on inmates, with written orders from Berlin. The camp doctors, including Rolf Rosenthal, experimented with different abortion procedures and stages of pregnancy. Other individuals like Gerda Quernheim and Percy Treite were involved in assisting or performing these forced abortions as well. Around 560 children were born in Ravensbr\u00fcck in the final year of the war. Most likely starved to death with 293 recorded as dead with no cause listed, but the figures are probably higher. Women who were identified as Jewish and found to be pregnant were sent directly to Auschwitz to die.\nAuschwitz is probably the most well known concentration camp: a place of death. But it was also a place where life emerged, thanks to Stanislawa Leszczy\u0144ska. Leszczy\u0144ska's and her family joined the Polish resistance after the Nazi invasion in 1939, smuggling supplies and false documents to Jews in the ghetto. In 1943, their activities were uncovered, leading to their capture by the Gestapo, a Nazi secret police force. While her husband and eldest son managed to escape, Leszczy\u0144ska and her younger children were arrested. Sent to Auschwitz with her daughter, she was separated from her sons and faced unimaginable challenges in the camp.\nAs a midwife, Leszczy\u0144ska was assigned to the maternity ward, which was more of a place of death than care. Leszczy\u0144ska refused to comply with orders to kill babies. Despite the dire conditions and constant threats, she delivered around 3,000 babies during her two-year internment. Her courage and compassion provided a glimmer of hope in the midst of a living hell and she was remembered by Auschwitz survivors long after the war.\nDuring the Nazi regime, Jewish, homosexual, disabled, and many other women and men were targets for Nazi persecution and death.

This remote manor served as the hub for breaking Axis military codes, such as the supposedly unbreakable Enigma ciphers. Women from diverse backgrounds came to Bletchley Park to contribute to the codebreaking efforts, and by 1944, they outnumbered men three to one.\nThe women at Bletchley Park held various roles. Mavis Lever and her team \"Dilly's Fillies\" cracked the Italian naval Enigma cipher, contributing to a major naval victory. Betty Gilbert, a Y-Station listener, played a vital role by recording Morse Code ciphers for decryption. Joan Clarke, a mathematics genius and friend of Alan Turing, led a team breaking German naval ciphers. Ruth Bourne operated the noisy bombe machines that expedited codebreaking. Osla Benning, a translator, decoded messages from German to English, including crucial wartime information.\nThough leadership opportunities were limited, women excelled in their roles. Bletchley Park provided an open-minded and equal environment, especially for neurodivergent women. Despite their significant contributions, female achievements remain overshadowed by male codebreakers like Turing and Welchman. \"The Rose Code\" aims to bring the stories of these remarkable women to the forefront, celebrating their intelligence, friendship, and the inclusive environment at Bletchley Park.\nVera Atkins was a British intelligence officer who played a significant role in the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II. Born on June 16, 1908, in Romania, she later moved to England and became a naturalized British citizen. Known for her exceptional organizational skills and dedication, Atkins became the intelligence officer in charge of the SOE's French Section. Atkins was responsible for recruiting, training, and deploying agents, mostly women, into occupied France. She personally interviewed and selected candidates, assessing their suitability for covert operations and resistance work. She maintained contact with agents in the field, providing support, guidance, and intelligence. She also played a crucial role in coordinating and overseeing sabotage activities, subversion, and intelligence gathering in France.\nThe official mission of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II was to deploy Allied special agents on the ground to coordinate, inspire, control, and assist oppressed nations' nationals. The SOE adopted irregular warfare tactics employed by the Irish Republican Army, training their agents, known as the \"Baker Street Irregulars,\" in sabotage, small arms, communication, and combat skills. Fluency in the local language was essential for seamless integration into the society, as arousing suspicion could jeopardize their missions. The agents underwent extensive training to resist interrogation an d evade capture, aware of the imminent danger posed by the Gestapo. Irregular missions demanded specialized equipment, and the SOE's Operations and Research section developed innovative devices for sabotage and close-range combat, such as exploding pens and concealed weapons.\nCommunication devices were crucial to maintain contact with the French resistance and the outside world, with radio operators carrying their equipment on their backs while staying mobile. Women played a vital role in the SOE as couriers, spies, saboteurs, and radio operators. Despite initial reluctance, they proved indispensable due to their advantages in travel freedom and the protection of gender stereotypes, which kept them above suspicion.\nNotable female agents included Nancy Grace August Wake, known as \"the white mouse\" for her remarkable ability to evade capture, and Odette Hallowes, who survived two years in prison at Ravensbr\u00fcck. Unfortunately, others faced tragic fates, such as Noor Inayat Khan, betrayed and executed in Dachau, and Violette Szabo, who met a similar end in Ravensbr\u00fcck. Sansom, Szabo, and Khan, were posthumously awarded the George Cross, Britain's highest civilian bravery award.\nViolette Szabo\u2019s (n\u00e9e Bushell) story is particularly striking, because she was the widowed mom of a daughter who never got to meet her father. Szabo\u2019s husband, Etienne, died in North Africa during the war. She left her daughter with relatives to go after the Nazi\u2019s whom she blamed for killing her husband. She grew up in London, initially living with her maternal aunt in France during the Great Depression. She had a tomboyish character, and was fluent in both English and French. Initially during WWII she joined the Women's Land Army and later the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). After Etienne died, in the midst of rearing an infant, she joined the SEO.\nHer first mission involved a role as a courier and wireless operator in France. She successfully gathered intelligence, and after a brief return to England, she was sent on her second mission. Atkin\u2019s choice to send her was interesting, because Szabo\u2019s young daughter was no secret, she even came to headquarters with Szabo at one point. On the second mission she was captured by German forces while coordinating Resistance activities. She was raped and tortured by Nazis while in prison and eventually sent to Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp. Despite harsh conditions and forced labor she maintained her spirit, aiding fellow detainees and even planning escape attempts.\nDespite the reality that war would end soon, around February 5, 1945, she was executed at Ravensbr\u00fcck, marking the tragic end to her valiant efforts as an SOE agent. After the war, on January 28, 1947, Tania, her four-year-old daughter, was presented with Violette's George Cross by King George VI personally. Violette and \u00c9tienne Szabo are considered the most highly decorated married couple during WWII.\nThe stories of these women, Szabo especially, transcend gender, representing tales of bravery, courage, and sacrifice. The SOE agents, despite not officially being part of the Armed Forces, dedicated their lives to protect freedom and help Europe defeat Nazism.\nAllied Invasion of France\nTo defeat the Nazi\u2019s required crossing the English channel to invade mainland Europe. France was the likely target where an eager civilian population awaited armed by people in the SEO. French women witnessed the invasion first hand. One of the best eye witnesses was Marie Louise Osmont, who kept a diary throughout the war and the morning of the invasion. Her gorgeous home, sat moments from the beaches. It had been occupied by the Nazis since the fall of France. On June 6th, she wrote and much longer entry, \u201cLanding! During the night\u2026 I am awakened by a considerable rumbling of airplanes and by cannon fire, prolonged but raily far away. Then noises in the garden and in the house: talking, loading ammunition bozes, nailing.\u201d After a long account of the raising alarm, she wrote, \u201cWe\u2019re deafened by the airplanes, which make never-ending round.\u201d She goes on to explain how she had to feed her farm animals during the invasion, that parts of her home were hit by shells, she talked about how her Nazi occupiers were \u201cnuts,\u201d but how she had to keep cooking during the onslaught. At some point one of the Nazi\u2019s says, \u201cthe Tommies are here\u201d and he leaves. She doesn\u2019t see English soldiers for several hours. The next day she witnesses what she calls a \u201chorrifying\u201d airplane battle. Her windows are broken. She said, \u201cYou have the feeling that a runaway train is passing over your body.\u201d That day, a French flag was rehung over the school by the Allied soldiers, and soldiers passed out chocolate, cigarettes, and other goods the French had not seen in years.\nAcross the British Channel, Bletchley Park, a British codebreaking center during World War II, owes its success to thousands of remarkable women. This remote manor served as the hub for breaking Axis military codes , such as the supposedly unbreakable Enigma ciphers. Women from diverse backgrounds came to Bletchley Park to contribute to the codebreaking efforts, and by 1944, they outnumbered men three to one.\nThe women at Bletchley Park held various roles. Mavis Lever and her team \"Dilly's Fillies\" cracked the Italian naval Enigma cipher, contributing to a major naval victory. Betty Gilbert, a Y-Station listener, played a vital role by recording Morse Code ciphers for decryption. Joan Clarke, a mathematics genius and friend of Alan Turing, led a team breaking German naval ciphers. Ruth Bourne operated the noisy bombe machines that expedited codebreaking. Osla Benning, a translator, decoded messages from German to English, including crucial wartime information.\nThough leadership opportunities were limited, women excelled in their roles.

However, a disturbing backlash soon unfolded, particularly affecting vulnerable women accused of \"horizontal collaboration\" with the enemy. Vigilantes targeted them, subjecting them to public humiliation, shaving their heads, stripping them, smearing them with tar, and parading them through towns while taunting, stoning, and beating them. Historians estimate that at least 20,000 French women were forcibly shorn during this period. The victims were predominantly single, widowed, or married women whose husbands were prisoners of war. Some women did engage in relationships with German soldiers, while others were victims of rape, false accusations, or personal revenge. This punishment extended beyond France to other occupied countries, and hundreds of thousands of women were used as sexual slaves by the Japanese military. These acts were particularly gendered and sexual in nature. Recognizing the experiences of these women is vital in understanding the long history of gender inequality and the scapegoating of women for the sins of men.\nOn the Eastern and Western fronts between Germany and the Allies the situation for civilian women was particularly vulnerable. As the Allies progressed toward Berlin, the call for avenging the deaths of those lost led to a belief by soldiers that almost any cruelty against Germany was permissible, including against women. Mass rape of girls in grade school up to elderly women was widespread and reported. Some Soviet women soldiers and medical staff did not object to their soldiers' behavior towards German women in the march through eastern Europe. There were instances where Soviet women even watched and laughed during rape incidents. It is important to remember that rape is an act of violence, not sex. Soviet soldiers sometimes resorted to using bottles instead of their own genitalia, leading to mutilation of victims. Soviet officers rationalized the assaults, viewing the victims as accepting their fate or even finding it enjoyable due to the soldiers' extreme sexual frustration. This distorted perspective allowed soldiers to commit heinous acts.\nThe soldiers' treatment of women was characterized by the desire for domination and humiliation. Rape was seen as a way to assert victory over the defeated German en emy. Rape victims included not only Germans but also Polish and Eastern European women.\nIn the west, allied soldiers, committed mass rapes too. German historians combed through the archives. They estimate that 5 percent, or around 2000, of the post war babies born to unmarried women were from rape and that close to 200,000 women were victims of rape at the end of the war.\nSurvival became a major concern for women, leading some to offer themselves as girlfriends in order to get protection, this didn\u2019t always work. Night hours were particularly dangerous, so women disappeared from public spaces, especially young girls who were hidden away. One woman was raped by Soviet soldiers in front of her young son. The thirteen-year old tried to protect her and was shot. This was the impossibly vulnerable position of civilians on the losing side of war.\nWitnesses still remember the screaming of women during the nights after the Soviets took Berlin. Hospitals in the city kept records and estimate that there were between 95,000 and 130,000 rape victims.

The Volunteer Military Service Law, passed in June 1945, is a good example. The law declared that women in Japan's colonies were Imperial subjects and could be draft ed to serve at the front. The law exempted ill or pregnant women and those essential for household survival. Women were promised burial at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo if they died, like the soldiers. All women between the ages of seventeen and forty were conscripted into a National Volunteer Combat Corps. The Greater Japan Women's Association was dissolved, and its members reorganized into the combat corps to assist the military in case of an Allied invasion. While female troops were not systematically inducted into the Imperial Japanese Army or deployed before the war's end, personal memoirs and oral histories indicate that some women did serve with weapons other than bamboo spears.\nThe legislation proposing a military draft for women is often seen as one of the final, desperate actions of a nation on the brink of defeat, although it had been considered since the establishment of Manchukuo in 1932. In a 1935 article, Matsui Shinji, an infantry major and press representative of the Army Ministry, argued against the belief that defense and women were naturally contradictory. He attributed the dominance of this contradiction to two factors: Japan had not faced foreign attacks since the Meiji Restoration, and the influence of foreign capitalist culture and liberalism had led to a decline in seriousness and the rise of individualism and pacifism.\nMatsui promoted total mobilization and emphasized the role of women as protectors of the home front, stating that it was no longer desirable for women to be distant from the front lines and the war. He provided examples of women who had fought on the front lines in both Japanese and foreign history, challenging the perception that Japanese people lacked the mentality for combat. Matsui also argued that the broken spirit of German women contributed to Germany's defeat in World War I and emphasized that Japanese women should not be disinterested in defense issues. Instead, they should recognize their duty to contribute to national defense in their own unique ways.\nThe Japanese held onto war long after Hitler surrendered, and their actions at the end of the war were nothing short of desperate.

Women around the world, despite their views and experiences in the war, could almost all share one thing: grief. Women lost everything in this war.\nConclusion\nWomen who had stormed into the factories, farms, and ranks had quickly seen their jobs disappear as millions of men left the service and returned home. Naturally, they needed and deserved work, but women in many nations were expected to return to their pre-war gender roles.

She was appointed Secretary of Labor, which was especially shocking considering the employment crisis that came along with the Great Depression. Perkins was one of the main reasons that the Social Security Administration was sustained through economic hardship and below is a speech regarding its success.\nI must say I feel very much at home even though I just arrived. I feel at home because the Social Security Administration has, ever since it was established, been a sort of special concern of mine, although by the chicanery of politics it was not placed in the Department of Labor. I, of course, thought it should be.\nAs a matter of fact, one of the reasons I feel so deeply involved with the Social Security Administration is that even though it was not in the Department of Labor when it was first established, the Department of Labor had to carry it the way you carry a dependent child. It didn't have any money. That was so unfortunate. And we didn't have very much either. but we did, however, was to provide the Social Security Administration with offices in the Department of Labor Building. I even gave to the Chairman of the Social Security Board (as it was called in those days) the large, handsome, red-upholstered, high-back chair out of my own office so that he could look like a king. I didn't have to keep on looking like a queen. I found the chair somewhat uncomfortable so I made the sacrifice.\nThe whole Department did the same kind of thing. We gave them our best statisticians. We gave them the best of everything including Arthur Altmeyer, who was the Assistant Secretary of Labor and my real right hand, and without whom I felt very lost. It showed that we put our best people in there on loan, and we carried it for the first year and made it look like a going concern. In fact, it became a going concern in an extraordinarily short time.\nWhen I asked what I was to speak about today, the suggestion was made I talk about the roots, or beginnings, of the Social Security Act. So I have thought about the roots. I suppose the roots--the idea that we ought to have a systematic method of taking care of the material needs of the aged--really springs from that deep well of charitableness which resides in the American people, and the efforts and the struggles of charity workers and social workers to handle the problems of people who were growing old and had no adequate means of support. Out of this impulse to be kind to the poor sprang, I suppose, a mulling of ideas about social insurance for the aged. But those people who were doing it didn't know that it was social insurance. They just kept thinking that something definite, something that people could look forward to, would be a great asset and a great assistance to them in their work. De Tocqueville, in his memoirs of his visit to America, mentioned what he thought was a unique state of mind of the American people: That they were so honestly concerned about their poor and did so much for them personally. It was not an organization; it was not a national action; it was not a State action; it was not Government. It was a personal action that De Tocqueville mentioned as being characteristic of the American people. They were so generous, so kind, so charitably disposed.\nWell, I don't know anything about the times in which De Tocqueville visited America. That was long ago, and I know little about the psychological state of mind of the people of this country at that time. But I do know that at the time I came into the field of social work, these feelings were real. It was surprising what we were able to do through volunteer work--by the volunteer support of organizations who help the poor; and particularly the aged poor. Just look over the country At the old ladies' homes and the old couples' homes and the old members' homes that sprang up because aged people had necessities that had to be met. In each case, somebody got money together and established these homes. And life went on for the aged, after a fashion, as recipients of a kind of charity. These things have been going on for years.\nPerkins, Frances. Speech. The Roots of Social Security. October 1963. https://www.ssa.gov/history/perkins5.html.\nQuestions:\nI must say I feel very much at home even though I just arrived. I feel at home because t he Social Security Administration has, ever since it was established, been a sort of special concern of mine, although by the chicanery of politics it was not placed in the Department of Labor. I, of course, thought it should be.\nAs a matter of fact, one of the reasons I feel so deeply involved with the Social Security Administration is that even though it was not in the Department of Labor when it was first established, the Department of Labor had to carry it the way you carry a dependent child. It didn't have any money. That was so unfortunate. And we didn't have very much either. but we did, however, was to provide the Social Security Administration with offices in the Department of Labor Building. I even gave to the Chairman of the Social Security Board (as it was called in those days) the large, handsome, red-upholstered, high-back chair out of my own office so that he could look like a king. I didn't have to keep on looking like a queen. I found the chair somewhat uncomfortable so I made the sacrifice.\nThe whole Department did the same kind of thing. We gave them our best statisticians. We gave them the best of everything including Arthur Altmeyer, who was the Assistant Secretary of Labor and my real right hand, and without whom I felt very lost. It showed that we put our best people in there on loan, and we carried it for the first year and made it look like a going concern. In fact, it became a going concern in an extraordinarily short time.\nWhen I asked what I was to speak about today, the suggestion was made I talk about the roots, or beginnings, of the Social Security Act. So I have thought about the roots. I suppose the roots--the idea that we ought to have a systematic method of taking care of the material needs of the aged--really springs from that deep well of charitableness which resides in the American people, and the efforts and the struggles of charity workers and social workers to handle the problems of people who were growing old and had no adequate means of support. Out of this impulse to be kind to the poor sprang, I suppose, a mulling of ideas about social insurance for the aged. But those people who were doing it didn't know that it was social insurance. They just kept thinking that something definite, something that people could look forward to, would be a great asset and a great assistance to them in their work. De Tocqueville, in his memoirs of his visit to America, mentioned what he thought was a unique state of mind of the American people: That they were so honestly concerned about their poor and did so much for them personally. It was not an organization; it was not a national action; it was not a State action; it was not Government. It was a personal action that De Tocqueville mentioned as being characteristic of the American people. They were so generous, so kind, so charitably disposed.\nWell, I don't know anything about the times in which De Tocqueville visited America. That was long ago, and I know little about the psychological state of mind of the people of this country at that time. But I do know that at the time I came into the field of social work, these feelings were real. It was surprising what we were able to do through volunteer work--by the volunteer support of organizations who help the poor; and particularly the aged poor.

October 1963. https://www.ssa.gov/history/perkins5.html.\nQuestions:\n- What role does Frances Perkins take credit for in the founding and continuation of the administration?\n- What does Perkins view the role of the Administration to be?\nHelen Stephens: Interview\nI had read everything I could about Adolf Hitler and I had read his book. And I felt sure I was going to meet him. The Ouija Board said I would. [W]hen we were in Germany, why we had English speaking, they called them guides, assigned to each Olympic Team. For instance, the track team had several girls assigned to them through the duration of our stay. They were sort of \u201chostesses\u201d for us. They would show us about. They could speak excellent English and through several of these girls who let their hair down, they were about our age, 18, 19, 20, and they began to tell us some of the terrible things that were happening over there. I had a friend from Poland who was going to school at the University of Berlin at that time too, and I went out there and met her. And she introduced me to an awful lot of people out there of course, teachers, professors, students, and I got the distinct impression that it was not only the Jews who were being discriminated against in Germ any at that time, but women in general, in the sense that Hitler did not see any reason for women to receive any higher education and that their greatest service to the fatherland was to have babies and more babies.\n\u2026He didn\u2019t care where they were, except to produce babies. And as I understood it from these girls, any German officer, I don\u2019t know whether that included soldiers or not, but any German officer had the right and the privilege upon seeing any German girl that he took a fancy to \u2013 to invite her to his quarters and to get her pregnant \u2013 and that was a high honor for the girl and she would receive a medal and 500 dollars. Well, these girls\u2026 They were terrified.\n\u2026 Well, after I had won my 100 meter race, I guess it was maybe 10 minutes after, I was still perspiring heavily. A German messenger came up, and I was standing there with Dee Boeckmann and he asked if, in English, if I would accompany him up to Hitler\u2019s box that the Fuhrer wanted to meet me. And I had previously made plans to up and speak over CBS radio back to America and Dee and I were in the process of going up there. We were just getting ready to leave and she spoke up and told him that, you know, we couldn\u2019t do it at this time, but after the broadcast we\u2019d be available. He said, \u201cI can\u2019t go back and tell the Fuhrer that you won\u2019t come. He\u2019ll shoot me.\u201d And we said, \u201cAh, he won\u2019t shoot you, there are too many people around.\u201d So he went back, reluctantly looking over his shoulder. But when we came out of that broadcast up at the top of the stadium, he was there to take us down, and Dee went with me. We were ushered into a room behind Hitler\u2019s box and it was a long room and we hadn\u2019t been there but a few seconds and the door swung open at the other end and about 20 Black Shirt guards came in and arrayed themselves around this room and pulled their German Lugers, loosened their holster, to see if their gun would come out easily, and they all stood stiff at attention and we looked at each other and wondered, \u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d Then Hitler came in\u2026 He was accompanied by his interpreter and strode forward and gave me a sloppy Nazi salute and I didn\u2019t return it and I gave him my \u2018ole \u201cMissouri\u201d handshake I always say. And he immediately came up and began to pinch me and squeeze me and pinch my fanny and all that stuff. I was kind of shocked, you know, the leader doing that.\n\u2026And he was asking me what I thought of Germany and what I thought of the Olympics and so forth. I was giving him affirmative answers and, I asked him if he would give me his autograph. He started to write it, then a flash bulb went off and he jumped about three feet up, straight up in the air and began to spout German and it was a little photographer, a fellow about five feet tall, a little guy and he began to kick him and he had these gloves draped over, his kid gloves draped over his arm, and he took those off and hit him across the face (MAKES SLAPPING NOISES ABOUT FIVE TIMES) and he motioned to those guards to come and get him \u2013 you know sick him and three or four of them came forward and one of them grabbed the guy\u2019s camera and he picked it up and bashed it on the floor and glass flew, you know the lens I guess breaking.\n\u2026 And then they began to kick that around in there like soccer, (MAKES FAST SLAPPING SOUNDS FIVE TIMES) you know, in that room, kicking that thing all over the place. And these four guys grabbed this little guy and carried him \u2013 his arms and legs stretched out \u2013 to the door and then they went, \u201cOne, two, three,\u201d and threw him out against the hall and he scooted right down the hall and then they kicked his camera out after him. Then Hitler just returned and said, \u201cHow would you like to spend a weekend with me in Berchtesgaden?\u201d Dee spoke up right away and said, \u201cShe\u2019s in training. She\u2019s got a track meet here.\u201d\u2026 and after a few more squeezes and he said, \u201cI was a pure Aryan type and I should have been running for Germany. I should be a German.\u201d Then he shook hands and he left.\nStephens, Helen. \u201cHelen Stephens Oral History.\u201d Kaplan Feldman Holocaust Museum.

What was going on the year the film was made that could bias the film? In particular, how do you think the gains of feminism will impact the portrayal of the female characters?\n- As they watch, ask students to research the historical accuracy of the film. What do online sources say about what the film gets right or wrong?\n- Afterward, ask students to describe how the female characters were portrayed and what lessons they got from the film.\n- Then, ask students to evaluate this film as a learning tool.

        "text": "After the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917, Kodak began a special advertising campaign aimed at soldiers going to the front. In a catalogue encouraging the purchase of handheld cameras, it was written: \u201cAnd when peace finally reigns, the war story you tell mothers, wives, sisters and children will become more vivid and real thanks to photographs.\u201d\nImagine the brainstorming in Kodak's advertising office, during which the above text was created. Surely it was supposed to sound optimistic \u2014 hence the word \u201cpeace\u201d and the promise of a happy return home, where veterans of the great war would sit among their families and would in the evenings, by the fireplace, tell about heroic deeds, showing women and children hand-made front photos of... Well, with what? What was really behind the slogan that the war would become \u201cmore expressive and more real\u201d thanks to cameras?\nDid the creators of this ad realize that in addition to group photos of comrades in arms, there would be those with the horrors of war, that soldiers would take pictures of the corpses of killed enemies with their own hands, the ruins of houses demolished by them, and even the execution of civilians suspected of spying? And they're going to treat them like war trophies? The answer to this question is not at all easy. Photographers have accompanied soldiers fighting at the front since the Crimean War, that is, since the middle of the 19th century, but technology stood in the way of capturing battle scenes \u2014 the first cameras were large and heavy boxes. So, most often static camp scenes and battlefields were photographed, that is, everything that happened before and after the battle. It wasn't until the introduction of lightweight and wearable cameras, such as Kodak advertised, that there was a real struggle in the pictures. In this way, people crossed another frontier of showing the bestiality of war.\nOn the antipodes, more is allowed\nJust as important as technical progress was the fact that, according to the postulates of Kodak advertising, cameras were massively found in soldiers' backpacks. Their owners, most often unaware of both artistic and technical requirements and moral aspects, took pictures without self-censorship. It was then that this race of macabre began, which today, thanks to the Internet, has the hallmarks of an epidemic of endless horror, where killing can be traced in all details... In the first decades of the twentieth century, the limit of cruelty to the enemy could be pushed further if one participated in a colonial war, against exotic peoples. In a word, racist ideas turned war into punitive expeditions, during which massacres and pacifications often occurred. British, French, Italian and German soldiers imported from exotic wars entire files of photographs documenting their own bloody exploits. The latter also extended the concept of \u201cexoticism\u201d to Eastern Europe.\n\u201cSomewhere in the East\u201d \u2014 very often Austrian or German soldiers would sign similar pictures sent home from the front of the great war. Wretched and ruined by war settlements, and before them their poor inhabitants, arousing pity, but also the conviction of the civilizational superiority of the conquerors. Similar photos were sent again by the German field post after the occupation of Poland in 1939, then large areas of the USSR in the summer of 1941. Fig. Wikipedia\nIt was not at all Adolf Hitler who first announced that in the lands inhabited by the Slavs it was possible to do more cruel things to each other. Already during the First World War, in the vast territories of the Russian Empire, German and Austrian generals felt themselves colonizers. At the time, soldiers sent home photographs of Jewish towns and Polish, Belarusian or Ukrainian villages, whose squalid, thatched huts were as exotic as the homes of tribes in German South-West Africa \u2014 the only Kaiser colony in the Black Land (present-day Namibia). Among the photographs, there was also no shortage of those in which executions and war destruction were captured. Both Germans and Austrians left behind gallows on which they hung people suspected of spying for the Russian army.\nJoseph Roth, in his famous novel Radetzky's March, wrote: \u201cThe war of the Austrian army began with court-martial. After days, real and alleged traitors hung on the graveyard trees to scare away the living. But as far as the eye could see, the living inquired.\u201d This cruel law of war did not escape the Polish Legions, as evidenced by this photo in the \u201cIllustrated Chronicle of the Polish Legions 1914\u20141918\u201d published in the 1930s. The caption under it reads: \u201cSpy from Kielce hanged under Konarami\u201d. Source: Illustrated Chronicle of the Polish Legions, reprint WIW, Warsaw 2018\nProfessor Martin Pollack in the book \u201cTopography of Memory\u201d quotes the memories of the Austrian poet, Georg Trakl, who in 1914, as a soldier, met with went to the Galician front, where he took part in the pacification actions of the Rusyn villages. The poet recalled one of them as follows: \u201cThere, in this square, which seemed to be full of chaos and life, it was again like extinct, standing trees. A whole group of trees, frozen in incredible stillness, on each of the hangers, the Rusini, the rightful citizens of this land. George Trakl could not stand these atrocities psychologically and with symptoms of insanity he ended up in a hospital in Krakow. He died there in November 1914. Trakl could not reconcile himself with the murder of people he was convinced of innocence; with the senseless destruction of Lemkov or Hukul villages. The sensitive poet in uniform belonged to the minority. Most of his colleagues unreservedly approved the orders of the command. In many of the soldiers' letters home were attached pictures from the \u201cWild East, where our army is finally bringing order\u201d \u2014 as one soldier wrote to his family in Vienna, forgetting that Eastern Galicia belonged to the Austro-Hungarian monarchy...\nTerror! Terror!\nAt the end of the Great War, in addition to light cameras, a hand-held film camera appeared, but for the following decades photography was still the main medium by which they tried to convey the horror of war. In the 1930s, the world press, not excluding the Polish one, was dominated by photojournalism of the Spanish Civil War. Depending on the political sympathies of the editors, the crimes of the nationalists and the German-Italian troops supporting them were depicted, the symbol of which was the ruined Guernica air raid, or not at all the lesser atrocities of the Republicans. Newspaper readers around the world watched how terrible a civil war could be, but quickly Spain was outclassed by two more conflicts of the so-called interwar: the Italian-Abyssinian War and the Sino-Japanese War. What pictures were sent from the fronts there fully confirmed the idea that more could be shown from exotic wars.\nThese pictures are from the 1935 \u201cIllustrated Daily Courier\u201d, where they were captioned: \u201cWild Abyssinian warriors heading to the northern front. Attention is drawn to a member of the auxiliary guard of Emperor Hajle Syllasje practicing shooting with a modern rifle. Against these \u201csavage\u201d fighters, the Italians threw aviation, armored weapons and artillery into battle, and when they could not break their resistance, they poisoned the Abyssinian settlements with battle gas on a massive scale. Fig. NA\u00cfVE\nRecalling both of these conflicts, it is worth looking at how they were perceived in Poland. Diaries with the \u201cIllustrated Daily Courier\u201d at the head published a lot of photoreports from both distant wars for the Polish reader. In the case of the Italian aggression against Abyssinia (present-day Ethiopia), the sympathy of most editors and readers took the side of the attacked. Images of the warriors of Emperor Hajle Syllasje were eagerly published, whose often \u201cmedieval\u201d weaponry (swords, spears and shields) contrasted too painfully with the modernly equipped Italian army. It was no secret that the Italians used chemical weapons prohibited by the Geneva Convention to break the resistance of the Ethiopian guerrillas. Sometimes the Abyssinians were only reminded of the torture of Italian prisoners, and it was pointed out that the Italians in the conquered territories had abolished slavery and built roads \u2014 a typical action of colonizers preparing conquered lands for future investments.\nThe Japanese then did the same in China, except that they were a hundred times more cruel than the Italians. Japanese soldiers imbued with the medieval samurai code of Bushid\u014d and the nationalism that grew stronger with each successive victory over chaos and civil war China, entered the heights of bestiality. The most drastic example is Nanjing, the capital of the Republic of China in the 1930s. After the occupation of the city by the Imperial Japanese Army, a regular massacre began on December 13, 1937. The apocalypse of torture, rape and mass executions, during which Japanese soldiers practiced bayonet thrusting or samurai sword cutting on their victims, lasted until the New Year. According to various estimates, the Japanese murdered between 50,000 and 400,000 people\u2014without sparing children and women.\n\u201cThe Japanese Army on Its Victorious March in China.\u201d It is clear that the Japanese passing the massacred body of a Chinese soldier are satisfied. Easy victories also fueled contempt and, consequently, cruelty towards the vanquished. And even a few years earlier, in 1905, during the Russo-Japanese War, war commentators emphasized that the Japanese army treated the enemy's prisoners and civilians extremely humanely... NA\u00cfVE\nThe Japanese army used war gases on a large scale against the Chinese (including civilians), and its air force relentlessly bombed defenseless districts of Chinese cities, such as Shanghai, which in November 1937 was almost completely destroyed. They were destroyed by bombing raids. This was the total war that the world experienced a few years later.\n\u201cChinese thief guarded by Japanese sailor in Shanghai\u201d. However, it is not at all certain whether this unfortunate man was indeed a thief, and not just a man accidentally captured on the streets of a pacified city, who was massacred by the Japanese under any pretext. Such a \u201cjustification\u201d of terror was used by the Germans after entering Poland in 1939, signing, for example, photographs with hostages \u201cPolish murderers\u201d. Fig. NA\u00cfVE\nThe Polish press closely followed this Asian conflict and published many photos from the areas affected by the fighting, including from Shanghai, but in articles and comments sympathy was rather on the side of Japan. This was mainly due to the fact that the \u201cJapanese samurai\u201d were seen as irreconcilable enemies of communism and, consequently, a rival of the Soviet Union. Nothing arouses sympathy and cements friendship like a common enemy. Who could have predicted then that two years later, in September 1939, the Poles would fall victim to equally ruthless and cruel actions by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. And ironically, Japan will become the only country to which the Polish government will officially declare war in 1941...\nIn August 1938, this picture appeared in the \u201cIllustrated Daily Courier\u201d, whose caption reported: \u201cMilitary training of Buddhist monks from the Temple of Eternal Peace at Eiheii-ji near Fukui, Japan. The monks are armed with Arisaka Meiji 30-Shiki and 38-Shiki rifles. The name of the temple no longer corresponded to reality at that time in the Land of the Blossom Cherry. Fig. NA\u00cfVE\nThanks to the popularization of photography, the war has indeed become more vivid and real, but also more terrible. The creators of advertising slogans from Kodak and other companies least expected that their products in the hands of soldiers would become another weapon as dangerous as a rifle, and most of the front shots would not be suitable for viewing in the family circle by the fireplace or the festive table.\nBibliography\nAndrzej Bartnicki, Joanna Mantel Nie\u0107ko, \u201cHistory of Ethiopia\u201d, Wroc\u0142aw 1987\nJakub Polit, \u201cChina\u201d, Warsaw 2004\nMartin Pollack, \u201cThe Topography of Memory,\u201d trans.

Photo / AP\nThe UK has been warned to expect at least three more days of heavy rain and flooding as the west coast counted its losses following the arrival of \"Winter Storm Hercules\", the system which has left behind a record-breaking deep freeze in the US.\nLast night a flood siren warning of extreme danger to people and property was sounded in Dorset, as gales and tidal surges battered the coast.\nThe Environment Agency raised the alarm after its sea defences were breached at Chiswell Beach in Portland last night, following on from a severe flood warning in the area.\nImage 1 of 9: People watch and photograph enormous waves as they break, on Porthcawl harbour, South Wales. Photo / AP\nDorset Police told families to move to an upstairs room facing away from the sea and arm themselves with flood kits.\nWhile evacuated residents in Aberystwyth were told they could return to their homes today, flood warnings remained in place across every region of England and Wales.\nThe Met Office said a further band of heavy showers was passing northeastwards across the country, and extended its severe weather warnings for rain into Thursday morning (local time).\nThis was reflected by the Environment Agency's flooding forecast, which said 45 counties would still be at risk as we head into the end of the week.\nIn addition to the severe flood warning at Chiswell, two others remained in place today - meaning there is also a real \"danger to life and property\" at nearby Preston Beach and the Lower Stour in Dorset.\nAround 105 less serious flood warnings are in place across the country, including in Dorset, Oxfordshire, south Wiltshire, Hampshire and along the river Thames, while the number of low-level \"flooding is possible\" alerts dropped just under 200.\nYesterday waves were recorded as high as 27ft at Land's End, and reports on surfing forecast websites suggested scores of professional \"big wave chasers\" had followed Hercules' movements across the Atlantic.\nBig waves slap against the seawall at the beach in Anglet, southwestern France. Photo / AFP\nThe British big wave surfer Andrew Cotton wrote on his official Facebook page on Monday: \"With the 'biggest swell ever' on the charts for Europe I'm packing all my equipment and hitting the road.\"\nHe told the action sports news outlet Grind TV: \"We left for Ireland on Saturday, getting on the last ferry before they were all cancelled.\"\nThe Met Office's chief forecaster said a \"large, deep depression\" was whipping up waves out to sea as a system of low pressures moved northeastwards across the Atlantic.\nNicola Maxey, a spokesperson for the Met Office, confirmed that Britain was feeling the effects of the same system that had led to such extraordinary conditions in the US over the past week.\nShe told The Independent the storm was \"a different beast\" after moving across the ocean, picking up water but also gaining heat. It passed to the west of Scotland later on Monday, but left behind a trail of devastation and took visible chunks out of much of the coastline.\nMeanwhile, the transport networks were still reeling from the widespread disruption yesterday as commuters tried to return to work after the Christmas and New Year holidays.\nWaves crash against the Aberystwyth coastline, in Wales, as strong winds and high tides continue to blow in from the west. Photo / AP\nThe storms were believed to have claimed three lives over the course of the past week. In Oxford, a 47-year-old man died when his mobility scooter fell from a flooded path into a river.\nA 27-year-old man from Surrey was found on Porthleven Sands beach in Cornwall after he was swept out to sea on New Year's Eve night and a woman died after being rescued from the sea in Croyde Bay, north Devon.\nSearches were still going on over the weekend in south Devon for missing 18-year-old university student Harry Martin, who was last seen leaving his home to take photographs of the weather - with more than 100 people volunteering to look for him.\nDevon and Cornwall Police said a 32-kilometres stretch of coastline - 16 km either side of the 18-year-old's home at Newton Ferrers - has been extensively searched as well as inland areas with the help of a range of groups and emergency services.\nJonathan Day, flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, warned at the weekend that the risk of flooding could continue throughout this week.\nHe said: \"Although high tides are now falling, there remains a risk of coastal flooding, especially on the south and west coasts.\n\"In addition, wet conditions have left the ground saturated in many areas, increasing the risk of river and surface water flooding.\n\"We would urge people to be prepared by checking their flood risk, signing up to free flood warnings and keeping an eye on the latest flood updates,\" Mr Day said.",

There is a risk of hail and thunder as well, but it should improve throughout the week.\u201d\nOne severe flood warning was in place in Dorset - meaning \u201cthere is significant risk to life\u201d - wi near hurricane-force winds of up to 70 mph expected on the west and south-west coast of Britain and the east coast of Northern Ireland will cause \u201cexceptionally high waves\u201d of up to 30 feet, the Met Office said.\nA gale is classed as winds of between 39 and 46 mph, rising to a strong gale, storm, violent storm and finally hurricane force for anything above 74 mph.\nThe ferocious weather which began over Christmas has left widespread damage.\nAround 220 properties have been flooded so far as miles of coastline have been hit, with roads and fields across the country under water and the conditions causing transport chaos in many areas.\nAnne McIntosh, chairman of the Commons environmental select committee, described the country as being in the \u201ceye of an emergency\u201d.\nThree people have already died in the storms, while the search continued today for 18-year-old London student Harry Martin who went missing while trying to photograph the weather conditions.\nRescue crews today embarked on their fourth day of searching for the photography student at Greenwich University, last seen leaving his family home in Newtow Ferrers, Devon, on Thursday.\n![](https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/01/06/09/commute2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&width=960)\nMr Martin had recently started a course in film production at Greenwich University but was back home visiting his parents Anthony, 57 and Georgina, 52, for the Christmas holidays.\nRead More\nHis uncle, Darrell Marshall, said: \u201cHe went off on Thursday morning with his camera about 11am and we haven\u2019t seen him since.\n\u201cHe is very interested in photography, he is doing a course in film production at the University of Greenwich, it is part of his course.\u201d\n![](https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/01/06/08/henleyonthames.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&width=960)\nPolice, the Dartmoor Rescue Group, coastguards and up to 100 members of the public have taken part in the hunt. Prayers were said for the missing 18-year-old in local church services yesterday.\nChief Inspector Shaun Kenneally, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: \u201cAll the resources we can muster are being used, but it\u2019s an extensive coastline and a rugged area that we\u2019ve got to manage, so it\u2019s difficult.\u201d\n![](https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/01/06/13/wav3.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&width=960)\nAn unnamed 27-year-old man from Guildford died after being washed out to sea after going for a swim with friends on New Year\u2019s Eve.

It was forecast to pass to the west of Scotland later today, and though not crossing the country led the Met Office to issue severe weather warnings for rain and 70mph winds along the coast.\nMeanwhile, the transport networks were hit with widespread disruption today as commuters tried to return to work after the Christmas and New Year holidays.\nHeavy rain fell across the majority of the UK last night, and with rivers high and ground saturated by the worst series of winter storms to hit Britain in more than 20 years, the Environment Agency said flooding was \"expected\" in almost every region of England and Wales.\nResidents in coastal areas were advised to be particularly cautious, with the strong winds set to cause \"exceptionally high waves\", the Met Office said earlier.\nYet the effects of the storm will also have been felt by those returning to work this morning.\nFirst Great Western warned passengers there was a risk to services in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Wiltshire and Dorset.\nSouth West Trains services between Fulwell in south-west London and Shepperton in Surrey were not running due to flooding, BBC News reported, while major roads in areas including Pembrokeshire, West Sussex, Gloucestershire, Berkshire, Somerset and Devon were also closed.\nThe Thames Barrier was in operation last night, while the Environment Agency urged communities in Dorset and Oxfordshire to brace for \"significant flooding\" in the lower reaches of the Thames, Dorset Stour and Frome rivers.\nThe agency also estimated that around 220 properties in coastal areas have been flooded so far.\nImage 1 of 9: People watch and photograph enormous waves as they break, on Porthcawl harbour, South Wales.

        "text": "Residents and business owners on the Aberystwyth seafront have been told to leave their properties in light of fears of further flooding.\nVery high tides with exceptional wave swell hit on Monday morning, with fears that this could cause \"serious injury, substantial flooding and damage to properties\".\nAnd Ceredigion Council has now said that another \"exceptional wave swell\" is due at 11.37pm tonight, carrying a threat of \"serious injury, flooding and damage to properties\", in the light of the damage to the promenade from the weekend's storms.\nA council statement added issued at around 4pm added: \"We strongly advise residents on the Promenade to vacate all properties and move to our Evacuation Support Centre in Plascrug Leisure Centre (please note change of venue from this morning) as soon as possible before 22.00.\"\nStudents who live in seafront halls of residence have also been told not to return until at least the middle of the week.\nThe Met Office warned that another band of gales and heavy rain is on the way and Winter Storm Hercules, which hit the US bringing major snow storms, has affected tidal swells.\nIt said coastal areas would be vulnerable to further flooding, with some areas being hit by winds of up to 70mph.\nEarlier, Ceredigion council said: \"Residents between Pier and Constitution Hill should leave properties and go to our Rest Centre in Penglais School ASAP before 10am.\n\"Everyone should keep away from the promenade as it is very dangerous.\"\nPhotographer Keith Morris, who was at Aberystwyth promenade, said: \"They are preparing for the worst, the council officers and police came around door to door leafletting and telling people to get out along the entire promenade from the Pier to Constitution Hill.\n\"People seem to be heeding the warnings but seem to be leaving via their back doors. It's all pretty dramatic.\"\nRichard Griffiths, who runs the Richmond Hotel on the promenade, said he wasn't going to evacuate.\nHe said: \"The council have recommend, in the strongest possible terms, that properties are evacuated right along the promenade.\n\"We had a team come in to start reopening the hotel after the storms on Friday, and we intended to be open this evening. We will now have to wait and see how bad or what damage is caused by the storm this morning.\n\"Barring any catastrophes in this morning's very high tide, we will be open tonight.\"\n![](https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/ee27OR8x/poster.jpg)\nBut despite the building's previous resilience he said staff would be evacuated later: \"We will get all of the staff out at the height of the storm, ensuring they are in safe areas but once that's over and we've had the all clear we will bring everyone back.\"\nIn Carmarthenshire high tides caused \"huge\" sprays along the sea wall at Pendine. And high tides again led to spectacular waves at Porthcawl, where a coastal path has been torn up in parts.\nIn Pembrokeshire, council workers were dealing with fresh damage caused by floods. Officers were investigating a collapsed footpath on the promenade in Neyland. Elsewhere, roads were closed and several areas reported sea water topping shoreline defences.\nJackie James, who works at the village's Point Cafe next to the front, said they were expecting the worst: \"The waves seem to be getting worse it 's now going over the roofs of shore houses. These are mega waves, spectacular scenes.\"\n![Waves pick up on Monday at Pendine before high tide](https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/news/article6471197.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Pendine-Monday-1.jpg)\nA Ceredigion council spokeswoman confirmed the Aberystwyth evacuation: \"We are putting up notices and urging people to evacuate ahead of the forecast tides and high winds.\"\nOn Monday morning, the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for wind covering the entire coastline, as well as a yellow warning for rain in north and north-west Wales.\nA Met Office statement warned about the areas covered by the wind warning: \"Strong winds will combine with large waves to bring the risk of coastal flooding.\n\"Winds will gust to 60mph or so on coasts, and locally to 70mph, but waves will be larger than usually associated with this strength.\n\"The public should be aware of the dangers of waves crashing onshore and over topping shore lines and sea fronts.\"\n![Waves come over the road in Pendine on Monday](https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/article6471328.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/pendine.jpg)\nAnd for the parts of Wales affected by the rain warning, it added: \"Some 5 to 10mm of rain could occur in less than an hour with locally 15 to 25mm of rain through today and perhaps as much as 40 mm on high ground.\n\"The public should be aware of the potential for localised flooding leading to difficult driving conditions, with hail providing an additional hazard.\"\nParts of Porthcawl's coastal path have been left impassable after huge waves undermined its foundations.\nRest Bay councillor Norah Clarke said she had never before seen such damage caused by the sea  there.\n\u201cThe tide has thrown up pebbles and it has covered large area of the coastal path. It goes right from Rest Bay around to Sker Point.\n\u201cPart of the boardwalk has actually been picked up and thrown towards the [Royal Porthcawl] golf club. Much of it has been undermined and is now completely unsafe.\n\u201cThe slip way by the Rest Bay Lifeguard Club has also been undermined. It was only extended last year and now it will need huge amounts of remedial work.\n\u201cThere is a lot of debris that has been thrown up on to the pavements in town.\n\u201cGiven that we have the second highest tide in the world, we have to feel grateful that we haven\u2019t been affected as badly as places like Aberystwyth.\u201d\nAt 2.30pm there were three flood warnings and nine flood alerts in place for Wales.\nYesterday the Welsh Government ordered a review of Wales\u2019 coastal defences .\nJust under 500 students live in seafront halls of residence at Aberystwyth. Many had already heeded the university\u2019s advice last Friday asking them to delay their return to university until the mid of this week.\nThe university told all students on Monday who live in the seafront halls and in private accommodation not to return until an update on Wednesday.\nAround 150 students currently resident in the halls have been evacuated.\nEnvironment minister Alun Davies, in Wales to witness the damage from Friday's tidal surges, said: \u201cFriday saw the worst storms to have affected the Welsh coastline for 15 years. My thoughts are with those affected and who have had a very difficult start to the New Year.\nFlood map shows flood warnings and alerts in Wales on Monday:\n![](https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article6471735.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/floodmap.jpg)\n\u201cI would like to thank Natural Resources Wales, local authorities, the fire and rescue services, the police, RNLI and other agencies for their efforts in evacuating those at risk and in undertaking the clean up operation.\n\u201cIt is impossible to totally prevent flooding but we are working to build resilience around our coasts in Wales.\n\u201cOur coastal flood defences have been severely tested by these storms and it is vital to look at how our sea defences have managed to stand up to the power of the recent storms.\n\u201cThat is why I have asked Natural Resources Wales to carry out this swift review with the immediate priority being to identify and assess any damage caused so that we can prioritise repair work and see what lessons we can learn to be well prepared for future severe weather, particularly given that these events are forecast to become more frequent as a result of climate change.\u201d\nThe Met Office weather warning for Wales on Monday:\n![](https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article6470395.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/warning.jpg)\nWaves of around 70ft have been reported in the mid-Atlantic, which are expected to be around to hit the Welsh coast in Pembrokeshire this afternoon - albeit at a much smaller size.\nNRW officials were continuing to monitor closely as more high winds are forecast throughout Monday.\n\u201cThis additional rainfall, following the recent very wet weather, means that the public should be aware of an increased risk of both surface water and river flooding as well as disruption to transport,\u201d said a spokesman.\nA series of train routes were replaced by buses due to the weather conditions, including between Machynlleth and both Pwllheli and Aberystwyth, Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog, Llanelli and Carmarthen, and Swansea and Pantyffynnon.\nHuge waves hammer the seafront at Porthcawl on Saturday:\n![](https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/SZr9Co4L/poster.jpg)\nHowever, the risk of further flooding today was not expected to be as severe as it was on Friday, when hundreds of homes were affected.\nThe wet conditions and storm damage were still causing chaos yesterday, as some roads remained closed and train services were disrupted.\nDebris remained strewn across the promenade in Aberystwyth, rail lines in north Wales were left buckled by the power of the sea and a road collapsed in Amroth, Pembrokeshire.\nArriva Trains Wales services between Machynlleth and Aberystwyth, Llanelli and Carmarthen, and Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog, were disrupted on yesterday due to flooding.\nHigh winds led to a lane being closed on the M48 Severn Bridge and in Pembrokeshire, the A487 was closed due to flooding between Welsh Road (Newgale) and Anchor Down (Solva). The council closed the road for the weekend, due to forecast of further storms.",

        "text": "The storms which have battered the UK over recent weeks can be traced back to a strong front of contrasting temperature between particularly cold air over the north Atlantic, which has also brought extreme cold and snow to parts of the US, and warmer air further south. The strong temperature contrast across the Atlantic leads to storms forming around the front, circulating and mixing air along the temperature gradient, trying to find an equilibrium of hot and cold air.\nYou could think of this as like adding cold water to a hot bath, where at some point the cold water entering from the tap forms a \u201cfront\u201d with the hot water, and must be mixed more evenly throughout the bath for a comfortable equilibrium.\nSo a succession of deep Atlantic low pressure systems, steered by a strong high level jet stream in the upper atmosphere, where winds are also driven by strong contrasting temperatures, has brought very wet and windy weather to the UK over the last month.\nThe run of stormy and wet yet mild weather has made this December feel very different to recent winters. In the UK, December 2013 was more than 1.5\u00b0C warmer than average, while December 2010 was more than 3.5\u00b0C colder than average as the entire country shivered in snow and freezing temperatures.\nIn fact the wet and relatively mild weather arriving from the Atlantic is more typical of British weather. But the depth of the Atlantic lows this winter has been unusual. On Christmas Eve as cyclone Dirk made landfall in Scotland, the the barometric pressure recorded in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis was 936.8 millibar, the lowest recorded anywhere in the UK since 1886.\nAt the University of Reading Met Department Observatory rainfall has also been quite unusual. A whole winter\u2019s worth of rain, 162.3mm, has fallen in just three weeks. Only another 1.1mm of rainfall \u2013 which looks likely \u2013 would break the record for the wettest consecutive 24-day period at any time of the year, 163.3mm recorded in late October 2000.\nThese very active weather depressions have wrought widespread damage and problems from wind and flooding. Winds have been strong, but not exceptionally so, with gusts of up to 90-100mph on the coast and 70mph inland. But the relentless rain has saturated the ground, and flooding has again been a major issue affecting many parts of the country. Southern and western coasts have also had to cope with inundations from the sea as, swept by the long run of strong winds across the Atlantic, strong sea surges boosted by high spring tides have challenged coastal flood defences.\nSo why has this winter started off so stormy, while other recent winters have been much more calm, and others frozen? Of course, the variability of weather from year to year and month to month is normal for the UK \u2013 we all know how changeable our weather can be.\nWhether the storms hit us or miss us is due to the path of the high level jet stream. But there is an added level of complexity, because the storms themselves influence where the temperature gradient is strongest and the position of the jet stream (meteorologists call this \u201cinternal dynamics\u201d). So it\u2019s very hard to predict exactly where the storms will be beyond the next five to ten days.\nInterestingly, winter storms in the UK tend to arrive in ten or 20-year cycles. For example, during the 1980s and 1990s there were more frequent periods when storms tracked across the UK, bringing mild and wet weather. But during the 1950s and 1960s the opposite was true, with more years when storms missed the UK to the north or south, bringing colder, icier winters. A \u201cstormy phase\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that every winter will be stormy, it just increases the chances.\nSuperimposed on natural weather variations is climate change. It\u2019s clear that over the past century the UK has warmed, as have many other regions. Between 1961-2006, winter temperatures rose on average by more than 1\u00b0C. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, providing fuel for heavier rainfall. There\u2019s already evidence of heavier rainfall over the UK and Europe, increasing the risks of flooding. Sea levels are also rising as the oceans warm, and this will also add to coastal flood risk.\nStorminess itself is harder to predict and forecasts of future changes vary considerably between models. University of Reading scientists have looked at results from the latest suite of climate models and found indications of a slight increase in the number of UK storms, but climate model projections are quite uncertain in this regard. While we don\u2019t know exactly if storms will become more frequent in coming decades, we do know that their impact is likely to become more severe when combined with the effects of a warming world and higher sea levels.\nWritten with input from and thanks to Dr Andrew Barrett, Professor Richard Allan, and Kathy Maskell of the University of Reading\u2019s Department of Meteorology and Walker Institute for Climate System Research.",

        "text": "Climate change impacts 'might already be considered dangerous'\nLanguage stark in latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report\n![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.2485708.1409147730!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/aptopix-britain-storms.jpg?im=Resize%3D780)\nGlobal warming is here, human-caused and probably already dangerous \u2014 and it's increasingly likely that the heating trend could be irreversible, a draft of a new international science report says.\nThe United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Monday sent governments a final draft of its synthesis report, which combines three earlier, gigantic documents by the Nobel Prize-winning group. There is little in the report that wasn't in the other more-detailed versions, but the language is more stark and the report attempts to connect the different scientific disciplines studying problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas.\nThe 127-page draft, obtained by The Associated Press, paints a harsh warning of what's causing global warming and what it will do to humans and the environment. It also describes what can be done about it.\n![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.2733569.1407785213!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/monsoon-india-drought.jpg?im=)\n\"Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,\" the report says. The final report will be issued after governments and scientists go over the draft line by line in an October conference in Copenhagen.\nDepending on circumstances and values, \"currently observed impacts might already be considered dangerous,\" the report says. It mentions extreme weather and rising sea levels, such as heat waves, flooding and droughts. It even raises, as an earlier report did, the idea that climate change will worsen violent conflicts and refugee problems and could hinder efforts to grow more food. And ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life, it says.\nRisks high or very high by end of century\nWithout changes in greenhouse gas emissions, \"climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century,\" the report says.\nIn 2009, countries across the globe set a goal of limiting global warming to about another degree Celsius above current levels. But the report says that it is looking more likely that the world will shoot past that point. Limiting warming to that much is possible but would require dramatic and immediate cuts in carbon dioxide pollution.\nThe report says if the world continues to spew greenhouse gases at its accelerating rate, it's likely that by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another two degrees compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005. And by the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7 degrees warmer.\n\"The report tells us once again what we know with a greater degree of certainty: that climate change is real, it is caused by us, and it is already causing substantial damage to us and our environment,\" Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann wrote in an email. \"If there is one take home point of this report it is this: We have to act now.\"\nJohn Christy of the University of Alabama, Huntsville, is in the tiny minority of scientists who are skeptical of mainstream science's claim that global warming is a major problem. He says people will do OK: \"Humans are clever. We shall adapt to whatever happens.\"\nWhile projections show that the world will warm and climate will change, there's still a level of uncertainty about how much, and that makes the problem all about how much risk we accept, said MIT climate scientist Kerry Emanuel.\nIf it's soon and only a little risk, he said, that's not too bad, but when you look at the risk curve the other end of it is \"very frightening.\"\nThe report used the word risk 351 times in just 127 pages.",

        "text": "A picture supposedly showing Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham with Geert Wilders, a far-right politician from the Netherlands, was widely shared on social media in March 2021 along with a caption stating that the photograph had \"just\" been taken:\nThis is a genuine photograph of Graham and Wilders. However, it was not \"just\" taken.\nWilders, who has been accused of spreading racist and Islamophobic views (he once compared the Quran to Adolf Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\"), posted the photograph to Twitter in September 2019 along, with a caption explaining that it was taken at the Ambrosetti Forum, an annual international economic conference in Italy. Wilders quickly deleted it, but Washington Post reporter John Hudson managed to capture a screenshot of the original post:\nKevin Bishop, a spokesperson for Graham, confirmed at the time that the photograph was real. Bishop said that Graham took pictures with several people at the forum, and that he did not know why Wilders deleted the photograph.\nThe Washington Post reported at the time:\nKevin Bishop, a spokesman for Graham, said Sunday that the senator took pictures with many of the attendees at the forum and that Graham has no idea why Wilders deleted the tweet with the picture of them.\n\u201cMr. Wilder took a photo with Sen. Graham as did many others at the conference,\u201d Bishop said, adding that he has \u201cno idea why Mr. Wilder removed the photo from Twitter. You may want to ask him.\u201d\nThis is a genuine photograph of Graham and Wilders. However, it was taken in 2019, not 2021. It should also be noted that being photographed with someone does not automatically mean that you share that person's views.",
