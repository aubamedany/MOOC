        "description": "Here's how we solved the mystery of what this viral video truly showed.",
        "text": "On Nov. 28, 2022, the @Xx17965797N Twitter account tweeted a video with a misleading caption that claimed the clip showed a sea of lined-up electric scooter bikes that were abandoned because of the high cost of electric vehicle (EV) battery replacement. The tweet read, \"Electric green scooters that have reached end of battery life. Due to the batteries being so expensive to replace, electric scooters are abandoned because disposing of them any other way is dangerous and expensive.\"\nThis was not true, despite the tens of thousands of combined retweets and likes that the tweet received.\nThe same video upload from @Xx17965797N was also misleadingly reshared by accounts including @PeterDClack, @JamesMelville, and @MillerForTexas. The former two tweets received thousands of engagements, despite the fact that the information pushed in the original tweet was not true.\nIn cases like these where a caption is incorrect but the picture or video is real, we issue a fact-check rating of \"Miscaptioned.\"\nThe Origins of the Video\nDays before the @Xx17965797N tweet was posted, the @ElevaBrasilES account also misleadingly tweeted that the same video was shot in France. The tweet went up on Nov. 21 with an incorrect caption that read, \"Green energy\u2026 Cemetery of electric motorcycles in France. Now designated as a 'biohazard zone.'\" (Note: This mention of France reminded us of other rumors we've debunked in the past, in particular about two photos of other car graveyards. The two pictures showed false captions that claimed the cars had been abandoned due to the high cost of battery replacement, just like the video we're looking at in this fact check.)\nThe oldest upload of the video that we could find came from TikTok user @smartsetting. The video was uploaded on Nov. 7 and by the end of the month had received nearly 5 million views.\nBased on watching the video, the scooters appeared to be parked in a parking lot near a basketball court, perhaps in a university complex or public park. Several blurry Chinese characters were visible on the side of the bikes. At the end of the clip, a tall building could be seen on the right-hand side of the frame. Other than those pieces of information, we didn't have much to go on.\nHow We Researched the Rumor\nIn order to find the truth behind this video, we first used Adobe Media Encoder to export a JPEG file for each and every frame from the video. The results of this export were 440 individual images from the 14-second video. We then performed numerous reverse image searches with these picture files using Google Images and TinEye.com. These reverse image searches provided several clues as to where other users had reposted the video. However, we did not find any further details from these searches.\nNext, we tried several searches on Google, Twitter, and YouTube with phrases such as \"electric scooter China\" and \"electric bike graveyard China,\" among other terms. This helped to find several reposts of the video. The searches also showed results for many of the sites in China that are the final resting places for massive stacks of bicycles dumped by bike-sharing companies with failed business models. Perhaps the most striking video we found was titled, \"No Place To Place\u2014\u2014The Wonders of Shared Bicycle Graveyards in China.\"\nAt one point in our research, we stumbled upon an AFP video from 2021 that appeared to show the same yellow color and model of electric scooter bike. The caption for the clip said that it was captured \"outside the city of Shenyang.\" The end of the video showed a stadium with special colors for seating zones.\nAfter an exhaustive search, we were able to find this same stadium by using the map tools on the Chinese website Baidu.com. Unlike Google Maps, Baidu.com has street-level views of nearby roads. However, this part of our effort wasn't very helpful. It remained unclear if this was the same location where the viral clip was shot.\nFinally, a Lead\nIn the end, it was going back to TikTok that helped us find the origins of the video. A search on TikTok for \"electric share bike China\" brought us to this video from @evstevepan. The video showed the same kind of yellow electric scooter bike with a similar logo. A scan of the logo using a mobile phone camera and Google Translate revealed the company name Meituan, which is known as an \"all-encompassing platform for local services.\"\nThe logos appeared to be similar. (Courtesy: @smartsetting/@evstevepan on TikTok)\nWe then searched the internet for Meituan and electric scooters, which produced plenty of pictures on Shutterstock.com. For a moment, the two large characters on the side of the scooter didn't seem to match those from the viral video. We then horizontally flipped a still-frame from the viral video, which led us to discover that it had been mirrored, meaning that all words and numbers were backward.\nIt's blurry, but it's a match. \"App\" appears on the left, too. (Courtesy: @smartsetting/@evstevepan on TikTok)\nAll of these developme nts in our research led us to news articles that helped to show our findings were lining up.\nMeituan 'Walked Away' from Bike-Sharing\nIn April 2018, news broke that Meituan had purchased the company Mobike for $2.7 billion. According to the story, Mobike is \"a Chinese startup that helped pioneer bike-sharing services worldwide.\"\nBut by November of that same year, TechCrunch reported that Meituan would be \"[walking] away from bike-sharing and ride-hailing,\" as there wasn't enough demand from customers for the supply of its bike-sharing venture:\nIn April, Meituan entered the bike-sharing fray after it scooped up top player Mobike for $2.7 billion to face off Alibaba-backed Ofo. Over the past few years, Mobike and Ofo were burning through large sums of investor money in a bid to win users from subsidized rides, but both have shown signs of softening their stance recently.\nMobike is downsizing its fleets to \"avoid an oversupply\" as the bike-sharing market falters, Meituan's chief financial officer Chen Shaohui said during the earnings call. Ofo has also scaled back by closing down many of its international operations.\n...\nDuring its third quarter that ended September 30, Meituan posted a 97.2 percent jump on revenues to 19.1 billion yuan, or $2.75 billion, on the back of strong growth in food delivery transactions. The firm's investments in new initiatives \u2013 including ride-hailing and bike-sharing \u2013 took a toll as operating losses nearly tripled to 3.45 billion yuan compared to a year ago. Meituan shares plunged as much as 14 percent on Friday, the most since its spectacular listing.\nJust as so many electric bicycles from bike-sharing companies had piled up across China, so had electric scooters like the ones seen in the viral video.\nIn sum, social media users falsely claimed that a video showed tons of lined-up electric scooter bikes that were abandoned in a \"graveyard\" due to the high cost of EV battery replacement. All evidence pointed to a simple answer: supply and demand. The number of electric scooter bikes and bicycles far outnumbered the number of people who requested to use them (or else they went missing or were stolen), which resulted in downsizing by some companies, and the closure of others. The clip appears to have been shot in China, although its precise location is unclear.\nWe reached out to Meituan for comment on Nov. 29 but did not receive a response in time for publication.",

        "text": "No evidence that hundreds of electric mopeds were abandoned in China due to worn out batteries\nCountless electric mopeds are parked on a site, a video of which is circulating online. It is claimed that they were abandoned because their batteries stopped working. Switching or disposing of them is too expensive. However, according to the company that sells the e-mopeds, they are temporarily stored for other reasons.\n! [electromopeds-china battery-climate change-electric vehicles-tiktok] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elektromopeds-china-batterie-klimawandel-elektrofahrzeuge-tiktok-706x386.jpg 1x,\nhttps://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elektromopeds-china-batterie-klimawandel-elektrofahrzeuge-tiktok-1412x772.jpg 2x)\nHundreds of yellow-black electric mopeds are standing in a row on a large area. Some shrubs grow over abandoned vehicles. This is shown by a TikTok video circulating on Telegram with the claim: The electric scooters have been abandoned because they have reached the end of their battery life. Replacing the batteries is too expensive and disposing of them in any other way is even dangerous.\nThe Telegram post has over 60,000 views. On Facebook and Twitter (here and here), the claim is spreading hundreds of times, even internationally. A Polish Facebook post claims that the video is from France. The contributions are apparently intended to create a mood against electric vehicles. For example, one user commented on Facebook: \u201cThe same will happen with e-cars one day, there will be huge stockpiles and no one wants to dispose of the batteries. \u201d\nOur research shows: The video comes from China and shows e-mopeds in a parking lot rented by a rental company. There is no evidence that the vehicles are parked there due to non-functioning batteries \u2014 the company denies having given up the e-mopeds. Media reports suggest that there were simply too many e-mopeds in Chinese cities and authorities were asking providers to remove some of their vehicles.\n! [This Telegram post places a TikTok video in the wrong context. According to Meituan, the company that sells the electric mopeds, they are in storage on a site in southern China.] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tiktok-elektromopeds-china-batterie-klimawandel.png)\nThe yellow-black electric mopeds come from China\nA reverse image search with different still images from the TikTok video does not initially provide any clues as to the origin of the video. We therefore took a closer look at the TikTok channel \u201csmartsetting\u201d, on which the video was published on November 7, 2022. One user commented on the post: \u201cWhy are they there? What happened?\u201d Someone answered: \u201cThese are discarded rental bikes in China. \u201d\nA keyword search with \u201celectric scooter china\u201d brings us to another video on Tiktok from September 25, 2022, in which a user shows how much it costs to rent an electric moped in China. They are obviously the same models as the ones that can be seen hundreds of times in the first video: The logo, the colors, as well as the basket on the front and the seat match.\n! [A comparison with the video circulating on social networks (left) with another TikTok video (right) shows that these are electric mopeds from the Chinese company Meituan] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elektromopeds-china-batterie-klimawandel-eletrofahrzeuge-1.jpg)\nChinese company Meituan: Electric mopeds are temporarily parked in a rented outdoor parking lot\nTranslated, the logo \u201c\u201d on electric mopeds means \u201cMeituan\u201d. It is the name of a Chinese company that offers various services, such as food delivery or the rental of bicycles and e-mopeds. We've contacted the company.\nA Meituan spokesperson wrote to us: \u201cThe video shows one of the Meituan parking spaces for electronic mopeds in a southern Chinese city.\u201d The e-mopeds were not abandoned, but temporarily stored \u2014 on the one hand due to current weather conditions and on the other hand due to instructions from local authorities to reduce the number of mopeds in operation. The speaker did not want to answer our request as to where exactly the e-mopeds are stored.\nWe cannot verify why the e-mopeds are in the parking lot shown in the video, whether their batteries are still working or for what reasons they are not being recycled.\nMedia reports: Oversupply of electric mopeds\nHowever, Chinese media reports show that there were apparently actually too many e-mopeds in some cities; authorities took action against this. An article from February 9, 2021 on the web portal Sina.com is about the effects of oversupply: so-called cemeteries for e-\u2e3a- Bikes and e-mopeds. The two-wheeler sharing offers in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province in southeastern China, would have long exceeded the city's load limit. The article includes the black and yellow mopeds from Meituan.\nReports from January 2021 also show the Meituan mopeds (here and here). The articles give two reasons for the mass accumulation of electric mopeds: There were simply too many vehicles on the roads and some would not have had a license. Changsha City Council has asked six companies, including Meituan, to dispose of and recycle all unlicensed electric mopeds. According to Changsha traffic police, there were around 460,000 e-mopeds on the roads, of which only around 60,000 had a license.\nWe have already verified similar claims about electric vehicle \u201ccemeteries\u201d in the past (here and here). Other misleading statements that created sentiment included, for example, that electric cars would supposedly become worthless after eight years due to battery failure, or that e-cars would only save emissions compared to diesel cars after driving 219,000 kilometers or 14.6 years.\nEditorial: Victor Marinov, Alice Echtermann",

However, there is no evidence for this and CO2 emissions are extrapolated on the basis of voluntary information.\n! [No, New York City Government did not announce \u201cCO2 tracking\u201d of grocery purchases] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nein-New-Yorks-Stadtregierung-ku\u0308ndigte-kein-\u201eCO2-Tracking-von-Lebensmitteleinkaeufen-an-e1687184395223-706x386.jpg 1x,\nhttps://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nein-New-Yorks-Stadtregierung-ku\u0308ndigte-kein-\u201eCO2-Tracking-von-Lebensmitteleinkaeufen-an-e1687184395223-1412x772.jpg 2x)\nAccording to a video report by Austrian online broadcaster Auf1 on May 11, 2023, there will soon be a \u201cCO2 shopping control\u201d in New York, which uses credit card data to track residents' food purchases and thus measure their CO2 emissions. The New York City Government announced this in mid-April 2023.\nAs we have already reported, Auf1 is more likely to spread conspiracy stories and disinformation. The narrative about the alleged \u201cCO2 purchasing control\u201d in New York is also false; the city government did not announce it. Press spokesperson Rolf Rosenkranz from C40, a global network of major cities fighting climate change, confirmed to us that New York does not record household consumption. In addition, although the credit card provider American Express had supported the creation of consumption-based emission data, this was purely financial. There is no evaluation of individual consumption data and this is also not planned.\n! [Auf1 falsely claims that the City of New York wants to track population consumption using credit card information] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Auf1-Behauptung.jpg)\nNew York's city government did not speak of a \u201cCO2 purchasing control\u201d\nAuf1 bases its claims on an announcement from the City of New York in mid-April. At a press conference on April 17, 2023, the city government presented an emissions inventory that for the first time also includes CO2 emissions from consumer goods. The data show that nutrition is the third largest source of emissions after the building and transport sectors \u2014 meat and dairy products in particular have an unfavorable climate balance.\nAgainst this backdrop, New York Mayor Eric Adams announced that he wants to reduce food emissions by 33 percent by 2030. However, this only applies to municipal institutions, such as hospitals and schools. There was no talk of monitoring or even setting maximum values for individual consumption at any time in the press conference, nor was there any talk of collecting data on individual shopping behavior via credit cards.\nHow are New York's CO2 emissions measured?\nCO2 emissions are normally collected where they occur, i.e. where fossil fuels are burned or cows emit methane gas, for example. This is also referred to as direct emissions. Indirect emissions, on the other hand, relate to consumer goods \u2014 the emissions are not attributed to the production plant, but to the households that consume the product.\nData on direct greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 is available on the website of the City of New York. The indirect emissions caused by the consumption of goods have now been calculated for the first time in a separate emissions inventory. However, the data does not come from credit cards used by people in New York to buy their groceries, but is based on extrapolations of voluntary information provided by individual households. The extrapolation is based on data from 2019 to rule out deviations due to the corona pandemic.\nEcodataLab has compiled the emissions inventory for CO2 emissions and explains on its website: Indirect emissions are not measured through the consumption or behavior of individual households. \u201cInstead, we use a model (a series of complex calculations) to estimate consumption of goods and services and associated emissions,\u201d it says. The approach combines real consumption or emissions data, where available, and forecasts based on demographic, regional and national averages.\n! [email from Ben Gould, chairman of EcoDataLab] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230619_Email_Ben_Gould-1.jpeg)\nWhen asked, Ben Gould, chairman of EcoDataLab, adds: The basis is data from the so-called \u201cUS Consumer Expenditures Survey,\u201d a nationwide survey in which selected households voluntarily provide information on their consumer behavior for a week. This data is Published anonymously by the \u201cUS Bureau of Labor Statistics.\u201d\nBased on this, it was calculated how certain factors \u2014 such as household size or household income \u2014 relate to consumer decisions. EcodataLab transferred these nationwide results to the local population in New York. According to Gould, these are therefore statistical calculations, not the tracking of individual consumption decisions. \u201cWe don't use credit card details,\u201d Gould wrote.\nData on consumption-based CO2 emissions is not based on data from credit card provider American Express\n\u201cThe city does not record household consumption,\u201d says Rolf Rosenkranz, spokesperson for C40, a network of almost a hundred major cities worldwide \u2014 including New York \u2014 which are working together to develop solutions to combat the climate crisis. C40 prepared the emissions inventory in collaboration with EcoDataLab and the City of New York.\nA C40 press release stated: The credit card provider American Express will support the preparation of a consumption-based emissions inventory. However, this meant financial support and not that data from owners of an American Express credit card should be used for recording consumption, as can be read in the emissions inventory published in 2023.

        "text": "In June 2020, an old episode of the reality courtroom show \"Judge Judy\" started to circulate online along with the claim that the plaintiff in the case was George Floyd, a Black man whose death while in policy custody in May 2020 sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice:\nPostings of this video were frequently followed by derogatory comments about Floyd and the insinuation that his past deeds, such as (allegedly) the carjacking discussed in the video above, either justified his untimely death at the hands of a police officer or made him unworthy to be the centerpiece of nationwide protests.\nBut the man named George Floyd in the above-displayed video is not the George Floyd who died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nFor starters, the person in the \"Judge Judy\" video is identified as \"George Floyd IV,\" while the full name of the man who died in May 2020 was \"George Perry Floyd Jr.\"\nSecond, the above-displayed episode of \"Judge Judy\" aired in 2010 and shows a 17-year-old who had been arrested in Chicago. That would make the \"Judge Judy\" George Floyd about 27 years old at the time of this writing. The George Floyd who sparked police brutality protests died on May 25, 2020, at the age of 46.\nWe confirmed with CBS that this episode aired in 2010. Furthermore, we found a December 2009 news article that appears to be about the same carjacking incident, and a 2010 law blog post about Judge Judy that also mentioned this carjacking episode.\nIn December 2009, NBC Chicago reported that a 17-year-old was arrested after he crashed a hijacked car. The Floyd in this article appears to be the same Floyd in the \"Judge Judy\" video. For example, in both instances, this person said that they stole the car because they were cold while walking home:\nA teen was ordered held on $250,000 bond Monday for allegedly carjacking and punching an off-duty Chicago Police officer Sunday night in the South Chicago neighborhood on the Southeast Side. He reportedly told police he did it because he was cold.\nGeorge Floyd, 17, of the 8200 block of South Marquette Avenue, is charged with vehicular hijacking, aggravated battery to a peace officer and aggravated fleeing, according to police. All the charges are felonies.\n[...]\nFloyd allegedly told police, \u201cI was walking home and I was very cold. I didn\u2019t want to walk home,\u2019\u2019 the officer said.\nThe website Legal As She Is Spoke also wrote about this episode in September 2010:\nEven those unfamiliar with her show got to witness Her Honor in action when, in a clip shown to the audience, Judge Judy issued a ruling in a carjacking case in which a 16-year-old defendant threw a woman from her car and drove off. His excuse? He \u201cwas cold,\u201d he said, expressing little remorse for his actions, Judge Judy spoke directly to the teen\u2019s father who looked as if he\u2019d given up on taking responsibility for his son. She also addressed the defendant\u2019s previous infractions and sentenced the minor to additional hours working for his father, thereby preventing him from concentrating on his \u201cpersonal life\u201d to which he attributed his poor work ethic.\nThe above-displayed video shows a person named \"George Floyd IV\" on an episode of \"Judge Judy.\" But this is not the same George Floyd who died while in police custody in May 2020. You can read our in-depth analysis of George Floyd's actual criminal history here.",

        "text": "Contrary to a recent bit of fake news that has been spreading around lately, George Floyd did not appear on the Judge Judy show when he was a young man.\nIn recent weeks, people have been spreading a misleading video online that claims to show Floyd in Judy Sheindlin\u2019s court room, facing charges for stealing and damaging a car. National Review has noted that the episode was shot 10 years ago, so if Floyd was 17 years old back then, he must\u2019ve been around 27 when he died at the hands of the Minneapolis police two months ago.\nThe problem, however, is this is a completely different George Floyd.\nThe man on Judge Judy is identified as George Floyd IV, but as for the man whose death sparked national outrage against racial injustice, his full name was George Perry Floyd, Jr. Floyd Jr. was 46 years old at the time of his death, and if the age discrepancy wasn\u2019t enough, Reuters did a photo comparison and found that the two Floyds do not resemble each other.\nJudging by the manner in which the Judge Judy video was spread around, it appears that this is a public effort to falsely portray George Perry Floyd, Jr. in a negative light as America continues to observe protests against police brutality. Ever since these demonstrations took off, critics have made attacks on Floyd\u2019s character in order to delegitimize the protests carried out in his name.\nWatch above.",

        "text": "WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN PORTLAND?\nProtests over the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis have taken place in downtown Portland for more than 50 consecutive days, drawing at times more than 10,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators.\nA relatively small number of activists have vandalised downtown buildings, including the federal courthouse, and attacked police and federal agents.\nTrump issued an executive order on June 26 to protect monuments and federal property after protesters tried to remove or destroy statues of people considered racist, including a failed attempt to pull down one of Andrew Jackson near the White House.\nThe Department of Homeland Security dispatched agents to Portland as well as Seattle and Washington, D.C., starting around the Fourth of July weekend.\nWHY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY?\nDHS, which was formed after the September 11, 2001, attacks to improve the nation's response to the threat of international terrorism, oversees some of the largest US law enforcement agencies.\nThat includes the Border Patrol as well as Immigration Customs and Enforcement, which are seeing less of their usual activity because of Covid-19.\nDHS also oversees the Federal Protective Service, which guards federal buildings along with the US Marshals Service.\nDHS sent members of the Border Patrol, along with Secret Service officers, Air Marshals and others, to Portland to protect the downtown courthouse complex.\nWHAT HAPPENED AFTER FEDERAL FORCES ARRIVED?\nFederal officers and protesters clashed in the streets outside the federal courthouse.\nDemonstrators broke windows and did other damage, hurled rocks at the officers and shined lasers in their eyes. Agents have fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators and arrested about 43 people since July 4, mostly for minor offenses.\nTensions escalated after an officer with the Marshals Service fired a less-lethal round at a protester's head on July 11, critically injuring him.\nThey ratcheted up further when agents in unmarked vehicles with generic \"police\" patches on their camouflage uniforms arrested people at night without identifying themselves.\nDHS officials defended the arrests today, saying they were carried out lawfully and intended to protect officers from violent crowds.\nThey also noted it is routine to use unmarked vehicles. But it seemed to many like the US had created a secret police force, and it drew lawsuits as well as more protesters into the streets.\nIS IT LEGAL FOR FEDERAL FORCES TO BE USED LIKE THIS?\nYes, to a certain extent. Federal authorities can enforce federal laws on federal property, like the courthouse in downtown Portland.\nBut state and local officials say the federal agents have operated beyond their jurisdiction, and that has raised constitutional issues now being challenged in court.\nAs Michael Dorf, a professional of constitutional law at Cornell University, told AP: \"The idea that there's a threat to a federal courthouse and the federal authorities are going to swoop in and do whatever they want to do without any cooperation and coordination with state and local authorities is extraordinary outside the context of a civil war.\"\nEVEN IF IT'S LEGAL, IS IT A GOOD IDEA?\nDHS has assisted with local enforcement before, but not without consent.\nIt sent agents to Puerto Rico to help confront a spike in crime linked to drug trafficking in 2013 and dispatched the Border Patrol's tactical team to track two escaped convicts in rural upstate New York in 2015. But as John Cohen, a former senior DHS official under Obama and President George W. Bush, noted, those were conducted in close cooperation with state and local authorities.\nEmploying DHS on its own, in a mission that seems to be suspiciously aligned with the President's re-election campaign, appears to be unprecedented.\n\"If the public begins to perceive that they are being partisan in how they operate they lose credibility, and if they lose credibility, they lose public trust,\" said Cohen, who now teaches at Georgetown University.\nWHAT CAN BE EXPECTED TO HAPPEN NEXT?\nThe Oregon attorney-general filed a lawsuit arguing that the federal government had violated the rights of citizens of the state by detaining people without probable cause.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has also sued, seeking to stop the federal government's use of rubber bullets, tear gas and acoustic weapons against journalists and other legal observers. These and other legal actions could force the federal agents to change tactics or perhaps downsize their mission in the city.\nActing DHS Secretary Chad Wolf at a news conference urged state and local authorities in Portland to work with the federal government to stop the violence directed at federal personnel and property.\nHe also sought to draw a sharp distinction between people demonstrating against police brutality and those attacking the courthouse. \"If you're looking to peacefully protest in Portland, the department respects your right to do so,\" he said.\nTrump ha s praised the DHS response and criticised local officials for letting a situation get \"out of control.\"\nAn official told AP that Homeland Security was planning to deploy about 150 agents to Chicago for at least two months in a mission expected to focus on gun crime, not the protection of federal property.\nTrump, who sees the use of federal officers as a way to embarrass Democratic local officials, wants them used in other cities. \"We're going to have more federal law enforcement, that I can tell you,\" Trump said.\n- AP",

        "description": "The presence of federal agents on the streets in Oregon has boosted crowd sizes.",
        "text": "\"I mean, that he can pick on our city mostly because of the way we vote and make an example of it for his base is very frightening,\" she said.\nFar from tamping down the unrest, the presence of federal agents on the streets of Portland \u2014 and particularly allegations they have whisked people away in unmarked cars without probable cause \u2014 has given new momentum and a renewed, laser-sharp focus to protests that had begun to devolve into smaller, chaotic crowds.\nThe use of federal agents against the will of local officials has also set up the potential for a constitutional crisis \u2014 and one that could escalate if Trump sends federal agents elsewhere, as he says he plans to do.\nFederal forces were deployed to Portland in early July, and tensions have grown since then: first, on July 11, when a protester was hospitalised with critical injuries after a US Marshals Service officer struck him in the head with a round of what's known as less-lethal ammunition.\nThen, anger flared again over the weekend after video surfaced of a federal agent hitting a US Navy veteran repeatedly with a baton while another agent sprays him in the face with pepper spray.\nCrowds had recently numbered fewer than 100 people but swelled to more than 1000 over the weekend \u2014 and they are once again attracting a broader base in a city that's increasingly unified and outraged.\nFederal agents again used force to scatter protesters and deployed tear gas and rubber bullets as some in the crowd banged on the doors of the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse and attempted to pull plywood off the closed entryway.\nThe Portland Police Bureau said in a statement that some protesters lit fires in the street and tried several times to light fires at the courthouse doors.\n\"It is time for the Trump troops to go home and focus their attention on other activities,\" Oregon Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, said on MSNBC.\nIn a news conference in Washington, acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf defended the agency's response in Portland, saying it has clear authority to protect government property and detain people suspected of threatening personnel or damaging such property.\nHe disputes that unidentified agents have arrested people, noting they have the word \"police\" on their uniforms. He said agents have been assaulted with lasers, bats, fireworks, bottles and other weapons and \"yet the city of Portland takes little to no action.\"\nWolf said the people committing the vandalism should not be considered legitimate protesters. He said DHS officers wear camouflage, as they do when they work on the border.\n\"These police officers are not storm troopers, they are not Gestapo. That description is offensive,\" Wolf said.\nBut constitutional law experts said federal officers' actions are \"unprecedented\" and a \"red flag\" in what could become a test case of states' rights as the Trump administration expands federal policing.\nElsewhere, the Department of Homeland Security said yesterday that it plans to deploy about 150 of its agents to Chicago to help local law enforcement deal with a spike in crime, according to an official with direct knowledge of the plans.\nThe Trump Administration also sent more than 100 federal law enforcement officers to Kansas City to help quell a rise in violence after the shooting death of a young boy there.\nFor days after the death of George Floyd \u2014 a Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck \u2014 protests against police brutality and racial injustice in Portland attracted thousands and were largely peaceful.\nBut smaller groups of up to several hundred people have vandalised federal property and local law enforcement buildings, at times setting fires to police precincts and smashing windows. They have also clashed violently with local police.\nA constant focus of protesters has been the federal courthouse, which sits in the heart of downtown and is now covered with graffiti and completely boarded up, with only thin slits cut into the plywood for federal agents to use as peepholes.\nPortland police used tear gas on multiple occasions until a federal court order banned its officers from doing so without declaring a riot. Now, anger is building as federal officers deploy tear gas.\nState and local authorities, who didn't ask for federal help, are awaiting a decision in a state lawsuit that seeks to restrain the federal agents' actions.\nState Attorney-General Ellen Rosenblum said in court papers that masked federal agents have arrested people on the street, far from the courthouse, with no probable cause and whisked them away in unmarked cars.\nThe federal government faces also another lawsuit, filed today in federal court. In it, the Western States Centre, two state representatives and others argue federal agents violated protesters' 10th Amendment rights because they engaged in police activities that are designated to local and state governments. The Western States Centre, based in Portland, he lps organize and promote the rights of minority and low-income communities.\nOfficials in Illinois and Chicago have also pushed back on the planned deployment there. Governor J.B. Pritzker called it a \"wrongheaded move.\"\nAs crowds have swelled again in Portland, most prominent among them now are the Wall of Mums and PDX Dad Pod, self-described parents who have shown up each night since the weekend by the hundreds, wearing yellow T-shirts and bicycle helmets and ski goggles for protection and carrying sunflowers.\nSome wielded leaf blowers to help disperse tear gas as they marched down a major downtown street and joined up with several hundred Black Lives Matter protesters in front of the federal courthouse.\n\"It's appalling to me, and it's a unifying thing. Nobody wants them here,\" said Eryn Hoerster, a mother of two children, ages 4 and 8, who was attending her first nighttime protest.\n- AP",

        "text": "![](https://www.boomlive.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/rohingya-children-story-featured-image.jpg)\nAs the anti-Rohingya rhetoric on social media in India grows, fake narratives are being spun around photographs of children as part of a divisive propaganda.\nThis is likely to get worse in the coming days as India woke up to news that Myanmar's army had discovered a mass grave of 28 Hindus in Rakhine. The Burmese army has blamed Muslim Rohingya militants for the killings. (Read - Mass grave of 28 Hindus found in Myanmar: army)\nBOOM came across two instances in the last 24 hours where fake stories were weaved around actual photos of children. The reactions and comments on these posts show that they have been extremely effective in stirring religious bigotry.\nRavinder Sangwan, who goes by the Twitter handle @Shanknaad and who is followed by Railways Minister Piyush Goyal, tweeted the below image of a little girl holding an infant. The image appears to be a screenshot from a BBC News video\nSangwan claimed that the girl was 14 years old and had two children. He also claimed she was married to a 56-year old man who had six wives and 18 children.\nBut Sangwan's story is a figment of imagination. BOOM traced the screenshot to BBC News' video - 'In the jungle with Rohingya refugees feeling Myanmar ' uploaded on YouTube on September 4th.\nIn the video, BBC's correspondent Sanjoy Majumder is seen trekking alongside people fleeing Myanmar. The girl in the image can be seen at 2 minutes and 06 seconds. The girl is not mentioned in the clip proving that the backstory given to her by social media is fake.\nScreenshot of BBC New's video\nWe found the exact same fabricated story on a right-wing Facebook page called 'India Rising'.\nAs India's Supreme Court hears a petition challenging the government's decision to deport 40,000 Rohingyas living illegally in India, some nationalists are leaving nothing to chance and are turning out a near constant drip of vitriol.\nAdvocate Prashant P. Umrao tried to pass off the image of a sick child in Brazil as that of a pregnant Rohingya refugee girl at a UN clinic.\n![](https://www.boomlive.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ippatel.jpg)\nOnce again, his story turned out to be fake. Umrao subsequently deleted his tweet when called out by BOOM on Twitter.\nBOOM found a Facebook post going back to November 2016 which contained several photos of the girl. The post in Portuguese states that Sandy Brand\u00e3o da Cruz, 12, a resident of the city of Garraf\u00e3o do Norte, Par\u00e1 (Brazil) was hospitalized at the Barros Barreto Hospital in Bel\u00e9m. She was suffering from a problems of the liver and spleen.\nA video where Sandy speaks in Portuguese about wanting to meet Brazilian actor, singer, dancer and TV presenter Rodrigo Faro proves that the child has no connection to Myanmar.\nIt's not just Hindu or Buddhists nationalists who are guilty of using fake images online to rally support.\nThe fresh outbreak of violence in Rakhine since August 25th has sparked a steady stream of inflammatory but nevertheless fake images from both sides that are muddying public opinion about the conflict.\n(Also Read: Rohingya Crisis: Fake Images Are Sowing Distrust And Fueling Bigotry On Both Sides)",

His endeavour was upheld by some sections as a shining example of the crusade against corruption and impropriety. He goes by the Twitter handle @ippatel, and his Twitter history is testimony to his proclivity for fake news. Alt News has on numerous occasions called out Umrao\u2019s bluff. His posts on social media are communal in nature and although he merely claims to be a \u201clay person interested in politics\u201d, his posts betray a right-wing Hindu nationalist mindset.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-5.jpg)\nIn fact, following the disqualification of Aam Aadmi Party MLAs by the Election Commission, Umrao was feted by prominent Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, hailing him as a crusader for righteousness.\n.@ippatel, the lawyer who led the crusade against 20 AAP MLAs in the #OfficeOfProfit case met me today as he is concerned about his safety & security.

India First Hinduism Best. Vandematram, Bharat Mata Ki Jai\u2014 Ashwini Upadhyay (@AshwiniBJP) January 19, 2018\nAlt News has documented many of Umrao\u2019s doings on social media.\nSpreading fake and misleading news\n1. In October 2017, in a shocking incident, a Swiss tourist couple was physically assaulted at Fatehpur Sikri in Uttar Pradesh. The couple sustained grievous injuries and the report made international news. Prashant Umrao was among those who spread the fake information that members of the minority community had attacked the Swiss couple.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-10.jpg)\nLater it emerged that the assaulters were not from the minority community. The detailed report was published by Alt News and can be read here.\n2. When it was reported that Vikas Barala, son of the President of Haryana BJP had allegedly stalked a girl in Chandigarh, following which a police complaint had been filed, Prashant Umrao was among those who went on an overdrive to shame the victim. He indulged in character assassination, posting an old photograph of the victim.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-12.jpg)\nThe male in the picture is not the accused Vikas Barala as was claimed and circulated by sections of right-wing twitterati. However this did not prevent Umrao from sharing such blatantly false and misleading information about the victim.\n3. When the Utkal Express derailed at Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh in August 2017, Umrao was among those who spread rumours of conspiracy and sabotage. He alleged that the accident was actually a \u201cterror ploy\u201d and claimed that clips of rail-road had been removed. He added that it could be a move to kill Hindu pilgrims.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-14.jpg)\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-15.jpg)\nThere was no terror angle to the accident. A preliminary assessment had suggested human error to be the cause of the accident. However that did not deter rumour mongers like Umrao.\n4. Prashant Umrao was among those who spread the news that journalist Ravish Kumar\u2019s sister had been suspended from government service on charges of corruption.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-17.jpg)\nIt turned out that the woman who had been named was not the sister of Ravish Kumar. In fact, she was not related to the journalist at all. Despite this, the rumour was made viral by right-wing twitter users, since Ravish Kumar is hugely unpopular with sympathisers and supporters of the ruling party and the BJP-led government.\n5. Umrao posted the following on Twitter, calling it a photograph of a \u201c9-12 yr pregnant girl.. from Rohingya refugee camp in Rakhine state, Myanmar\u201d. \u201cShe is in UN clinic, giving birth to a child soon,\u201d he had added.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-19.jpg)\nT he fake news was called out almost immediately after he had posted it. The photograph is actually of a Brazilian girl from Garraf\u00e3o do Norte, who was suffering from liver disease. Umrao quietly deleted his tweet without an apology.\nDespite being caught repeatedly for lying, what has been presented so far will seem benign in comparison to what Umrao regularly posts on social media. Umrao was a member of the Facebook group \u201cHindu Defence League\u201d. He was also a member of the Hindu Sena who became famous for celebrating U.S President Donald Trump\u2019s birthday, heralding him as the \u201csaviour of humanity\u201d. His posts and messages are replete with violence and gore, openly calling for bloodshed and using some of the vilest language to describe minorities and women.\nRants against religious minorities\nUmrao\u2019s pathological hatred for Muslims is on full display on social media. In the following tweet, he brazenly calls for slaying each and every Muslim to pieces.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-21.jpg)\nRough translation: \u201cEach and every Muslim has to be butchered. Every mosque has to be destroyed. Akhilesh, stop us if you can. All brave Hindu of the country are called upon to proceed to Muzaffarnagar.\u201d\nThis tweet was in the aftermath of the communal violence that rocked the Muzaffarnagar region in 2013.\nIn another tweet, he lamented the role of the police, and said they were oppressing Hindus instead of preventing their slaughter by Muslims.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-23.jpg)\nIn another tweet of March 2014, he reminded people of the violence unleashed in Muzaffarnagar and Godhra, saying \u201cImran Masud, we will finish what you begin, just like Godhra. Then keep shouting for 10 years, like Gujarat. Do you remember Muzaffarnagar?\u201d:\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-25.jpg)\nIn yet another tweet of 2014, he used a derogatory reference for Muslims and said he wished to see them butchered.\nAll Half Dicks are good in Killing and Slaughtering.\u2014 Prashant P. Umrao (@ippatel) February 18, 2014\nI wish to see those sub human butchered like this.#MyJihad#HDL pic.twitter.com/IbfAc727Al\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-28.jpg)\nNot only Muslims, Umrao has also targeted the Sikh community through his tweets.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-30.jpg)\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-31.jpg)\nLove for Godse and Hitler\nUmrao\u2019s attitude and beliefs are unsurprising, considering that he venerates and eulogises Nathuram Godse, the murderer of Mahatma Gandhi.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-33.jpg)\nHe is also a big fan of German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, praising and defending him on social media.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-35.jpg)\nHatred for women\nUmrao is rather unabashed about his misogynistic instincts and tendencies. On a number of occasions, he has posted provocative and outrageous tweets and messages, derogatorily referring to women, reducing them to body parts and using vituperative language.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-37.jpg)\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-38.jpg)\nIn the tweet above he targets Shah Rukh Khan and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee with an outrageous comment. Umrao reiterated his despicable attitude with regard to the West Bengal chief minister in another instance.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-40.jpg)\nUmrao consistently targets celebrities through his tweets and often resorts to abusive language.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-42.jpg)\nHate for seculars\nUmrao displays profound hatred and disdain for those who consider and call themselves \u201csecular\u201d. Sample his tweets below. He targets director Mahesh Bhatt who has often voiced opinions unpalatable to the establishment.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-44.jpg)\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-45.jpg)\nUmrao\u2019s language is toxic but his lack of conviction with regard to what he believes is unable to stay hidden. After his controversial tweets started drawing attention, he went about deleting them quietly.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-47.jpg)\nPrashant Umrao is representative of the hardened elements of the Hindutva ecosystem. He makes use of his new-found popularity to spread messages of hate and violence against minorities and women with impunity. His posts are an open incitement to bloodshed. He also regularly posts fake and misleading information. Despite the obvious bigotry on display, people like Umrao thrive on social media and are promoted by politicians. They have a loyal following of similar-minded persons who are more than eager to lap up the hate, spreading its tentacles further. There is an urgent need to take action against him and all those who are openly flouting  the law and irreparably rupturing the social fabric in the process.\nThis article first appeared on Alt news.",

Must feel like the MCG in 1992 for Imran Khan\u201d.\nUrduPoint, a website based in Pakistan, also published the image in April 2018.\nReuters images of the April 21, 2022 Lahore rally in support of Khan can be viewed (here).\nImran Khan also released a video of the gathering on his Facebook page.\nPakistan\u2019s lower house of parliament voted on April 10 to remove Khan from office, following a nearly 14-hour standoff between the opposition and Khan\u2019s ruling PTI party.\nKhan has since demanded fresh elections amid political turmoil after a new government took over and warned it faces an enormous challenge to revive a battered economy.\nReuters previously addressed another miscaptioned image of a dense crowd gathered late in the day that was shared online with the false claim that it showed an April 13, 2022 rally in support of Khan. That image dates to at least March 27, 2022, prior to Khan\u2019s removal as prime minister.\nVERDICT\nMiscaptioned. An image of a mass gathering taken during the night was not captured in April 2022 at a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) rally. A reverse image search reveals that the image was taken at a rally in April 2018.",

Junaid Akbar also praised Ali Amin Gandapur, stating that he took charge of the party at a time when no one else was willing to do so. He added that no financial request would be made to Ali Amin Gandapur for the rally\u2019s expenses.\nJunaid Akbar said that each village council must arrange transportation and mobilisation of workers at its own level for PTI\u2019s February 8 rally.",

Major thoroughfares including Saggian, Shahdara, Data Darbar, and roads surrounding the Lahore Railway Station are heavily fortified, causing significant traffic bottlenecks.\nTraffic Disruption in Lahore\nThe placement of containers has already created congestion throughout the city, especially in areas close to Minar-e-Pakistan, where the rally is scheduled to take place. Commuters are advised to plan alternate routes as authorities are enforcing strict security protocols, further exacerbating the traffic situation.\nMinar-e-Pakistan Sealed Off\nAll six entry gates to Minar-e-Pakistan are locked by authorities, following directives from the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA). Containers have also been placed within the monument\u2019s grounds to prevent access, leaving tourists and locals barred from visiting the historic site.\nPTI leadership has instructed workers to remain peaceful and avoid confrontations with law enforcement. They have also outlined a flexible strategy to hold rallies at alternate locations if entry to Minar-e-Pakistan is denied. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter of the party is gearing up, with each MPA tasked with mobilizing 500 supporters for the event.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene was wearing a wire during her testimony digitally altered\n(Reuters) An image has been shared by users online making it appear as if U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene was wearing a wire while she was testifying on April 22, 2022, in a Georgia state court is digitally altered. A clearer version of the screenshot viewable on C-SPAN of the livestream of her testimony shows Taylor Greene flicking her hair, and not adjusting a wire or earpiece.\nTaylor Greene was testifying in a Georgia state court in Atlanta in a novel legal challenge to her candidacy accusing her of violating a U.S. Constitution provision called the \"Insurrectionist Disqualification Clause\" by supporting an incendiary rally that preceded last year\u2019s attack on the U.S. Capitol ( here ).\nUsers subsequently shared an image online of Greene during the testimony with claims that the representative was wearing a hearing device.\nOne user shared the image on Twitter with text that reads: \u201cThe tweet pointing this out has retweets disabled, so I copied the pic bc people should see. Earpiece at her armpit, got suck [sic] in her hair. See?\u201d ( here ).\nThe tweet had over 5,600 likes and 3,400 shares at the time of writing.\nThe image circulating online is heavily filtered and does not show the Republican representative wearing a wire device. Instead, a clearer version of the screenshot as seen on the livestream of the testimony shows Taylor Greene fixing her hair ( here ).\nThe filter on the image circulating online makes it appear as if a thick strand of Greene\u2019s hair is a type of earpiece.\nThe clip is also viewable on C-SPAN, Part 4 of her testimony at the administrative hearing [at 1:15:08] where Greene is seen fixing her hair, not flicking aside a wire ( here ).\nA spokesperson for Greene, Nick Dyer, also told Reuters that the image does not show Greene wearing an earpiece.\nOn April 18, 2022, a federal judge ruled that a lawsuit seeking to block Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene from seeking reelection, alleging she is unfit for office because of her support of rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol, can proceed.\nReuters previously addressed the baseless claim circulating shortly after the 2020 U.S. presidential debates in September 2020 that the Democrat contender and current president Joe Biden was wearing a wire ( here ).The image circulating online at the time likely showed a crease in Biden\u2019s shirt.\nVERDICT\nAltered.

A clearer version of the screenshot viewable on a C-SPAN livestream of Greene\u2019s testimony in a Georgia state court on April 22, 2022, shows the Republican fixing her hair, not shifting an earpiece.",

Some online users had claimed that White House spokesperson Jen Psaki had announced plans to reform the law shortly after the news billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk had reached an agreement to buy the social media platform, Twitter.\nAnother commented on Facebook: \u201cBREAKING NEWS: Now that Musk will own Twitter, the White House is concerned about reforming Section 230. Imagine that?????\u201d (here).\nOther social media posts claiming Section 230 reforms are urgently in focus can be seen (here), (here) and (here).\n\u2014 George (@BehizyTweets) April 25, 2022\nThe press secretary made no announcements in relation to Section 230 during the April 25, 2022 briefing. Reforming Section 230 has been a longstanding aim of President Biden, a spokesperson for the White House told Reuters.\nSection 230 was explicitly mentioned twice during Monday\u2019s briefing in response to questions posed by reporters. The full transcript of the briefing can be found (here) while a livestream of the briefing can be viewed (bit.ly/3LlMeTI).\nA reporter asked Psaki: \u201cAnd just a quick one on the breaking news: Twitter agreeing to let Elon Musk purchase \u2014 make his \u2014 go through with this purchase. Do you have a response to that? And does the White House have any concern that this new agreement might have President Trump back on the platform?\u201d\nIn response, Psaki said: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to comment on a specific transaction ... [Biden] has been a strong supporter of fundamental reforms to achieve that goal, including reforms to Section 230, enacting antitrust reforms, requiring more transparency, and more. And he\u2019s encouraged that there\u2019s bipartisan interest in Congress\u201d.\nAnother reporter asked: \u201cI\u2019m wondering: Regardless of ownership, would the White House be interested in working with Twitter like it has in the past to continue to combat this kind of misinformation? Or are we in a different part of the pandemic where that kind of partnership is no longer necessary?\u201d\nPsaki answered: \u201cWell, I think we engage regularly with all social media platforms about steps that can be taken that has continued, and I\u2019m sure it will continue. But there are also reforms that we think Congress could take and we would support taking, including reforming Section 230, enacting antitrust reforms, requiring more transparency. And the president is encouraged by the bipartisan support for \u2014 or engagement in those efforts\u201d.\nPresident Biden has previously spoken in support of reforming Section 230, so to present this as a sudden policy decision would be misleading.\nIn an interview with The New York Times editorial board in January 2020, shortly after his victory in the 2020 presidential elections, Biden voiced his view that the law should be revoked immediately.\nIn an October 2021 briefing, a reporter asked Psaki: \u201cThanks, Jen. Yesterday\u2019s hearing by a Facebook whistleblower underscored several major issues with the company, including, as many senators pointed out, issues with Section 230. On the campaign trail, Biden said that Section 230 should, quote, \"immediately be revoked\" and that it should be revoked because, quote, Facebook \"is not just an Internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false.\" Does the White House stand by that assessment for Section 230, given the revelations now?\u201d\nPsaki responded: \u201cWell, the President has long said, as you referenced, that tech platforms must be held accountable for the harms that they cause. And he has been a strong supporter of fundamental reforms to achieve that goal. This includes Section 230 reforms. It also includes privacy and antitrust reforms as well as more transparency\u201d.\nIn a November 2021 press briefing, Psaki reaffirmed President Biden\u2019s position on Section 230.\nA reporter posed a question on whether Biden supports revoking the law after the Justice Department defended Section 230 in a lawsuit filed by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Psaki responded: \u201c[Biden] called for reforms of Section 230; that continues to be his position\u201d.\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump also expression an intention to revoke Section 230 when he was in office.\nSection 230 was a central talking point during the October 2020 tech hearing, where Democrats and Republicans quizzed \u2018Big Tech\u2019 CEOs on policies.\nLawmakers have been split on ways to hold Big Tech accountable under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - which protects companies from liability over content  posted by users but also lets the firms shape political discourse.\nRepublican lawmakers used most of their time during the hearing to accuse the companies of selective censorship against conservatives. Democrats primarily focused on insufficient action against misinformation that interferes with the election.\nIn response to several questions discussing the law, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google said Section 230 was crucial to free expression on the internet. They said the law gives them the tools to strike a balance between preserving free speech and moderating content, even as they appeared open to suggestions the law needs moderate changes.\nVERDICT\nMissing context. The White House did not make any new announcements pertaining to Section 230, a law that shields online companies from liability over content posted by users, following Elon Musk\u2019s agreement with Twitter to buy the platform. Press Secretary Jen Psaki responded to press questions on the topic on Monday. President Biden repeatedly expressed support for reforming the law prior to Musk\u2019s agreement with Twitter.",

It reads: \u201cCongratulations @ElonMusk and @SpaceX on the successful #FalconHeavy launch. This achievement, along with @NASA\u2019s commercial and international partners, continues to show American ingenuity at its best!\u201d\nAt the time, Musk, chief executive of the aerospace company SpaceX, replied, saying: \u201cThank you on behalf of SpaceX. An exciting future lies ahead!\u201d (see here ).\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 7, 2018\nHowever, the fabricated screenshot (which is likely to have been edited from the original exchange as the date and minute timestamps match), appears to show Musk replying: \u201cI\u2019m from South Africa you dumbass.\u201d See example here ( here ).\nReuters found no evidence of Musk ever tweeting this. An advanced search on his Twitter feed brought no relevant results ( bit.ly/3Lm6btN ).\nWhile the fabricated screenshot has been online since at least Feb. 10, 2018 ( here) (here ) and debunked since by Snopes ( here ), the content has resurfaced after the news broke of Musk\u2019s Twitter deal on April 25, 2022.\nAn iteration posted on Twitter has been retweeted more than 2,400 times since it was posted on April 25 archived here ( here ).\nApril 26, 2022\n\u201cPeople worrying that Elon Musk will support Trump on Twitter easily forget their dialogue on the platform,\u201d a Facebook user commented (here ).\nMusk, born in Pretoria, South Africa, clinched a deal to buy Twitter Inc for $44 billion cash on April 25 in a transaction that will shift control of the social media platform populated by millions of users and global leaders to the world\u2019s richest person ( here ).\nVERDICT\nFalse. This screenshot allegedly showing Elon Musk calling former U.S. President Donald Trump a \u201cdumbass\u201d is fabricated.",

        "description": "Here's how we solved the mystery of what this viral video truly showed.",
        "text": "On Nov. 28, 2022, the @Xx17965797N Twitter account tweeted a video with a misleading caption that claimed the clip showed a sea of lined-up electric scooter bikes that were abandoned because of the high cost of electric vehicle (EV) battery replacement. The tweet read, \"Electric green scooters that have reached end of battery life. Due to the batteries being so expensive to replace, electric scooters are abandoned because disposing of them any other way is dangerous and expensive.\"\nThis was not true, despite the tens of thousands of combined retweets and likes that the tweet received.\nThe same video upload from @Xx17965797N was also misleadingly reshared by accounts including @PeterDClack, @JamesMelville, and @MillerForTexas. The former two tweets received thousands of engagements, despite the fact that the information pushed in the original tweet was not true.\nIn cases like these where a caption is incorrect but the picture or video is real, we issue a fact-check rating of \"Miscaptioned.\"\nThe Origins of the Video\nDays before the @Xx17965797N tweet was posted, the @ElevaBrasilES account also misleadingly tweeted that the same video was shot in France. The tweet went up on Nov. 21 with an incorrect caption that read, \"Green energy\u2026 Cemetery of electric motorcycles in France. Now designated as a 'biohazard zone.'\" (Note: This mention of France reminded us of other rumors we've debunked in the past, in particular about two photos of other car graveyards. The two pictures showed false captions that claimed the cars had been abandoned due to the high cost of battery replacement, just like the video we're looking at in this fact check.)\nThe oldest upload of the video that we could find came from TikTok user @smartsetting. The video was uploaded on Nov. 7 and by the end of the month had received nearly 5 million views.\nBased on watching the video, the scooters appeared to be parked in a parking lot near a basketball court, perhaps in a university complex or public park. Several blurry Chinese characters were visible on the side of the bikes. At the end of the clip, a tall building could be seen on the right-hand side of the frame. Other than those pieces of information, we didn't have much to go on.\nHow We Researched the Rumor\nIn order to find the truth behind this video, we first used Adobe Media Encoder to export a JPEG file for each and every frame from the video. The results of this export were 440 individual images from the 14-second video. We then performed numerous reverse image searches with these picture files using Google Images and TinEye.com. These reverse image searches provided several clues as to where other users had reposted the video. However, we did not find any further details from these searches.\nNext, we tried several searches on Google, Twitter, and YouTube with phrases such as \"electric scooter China\" and \"electric bike graveyard China,\" among other terms. This helped to find several reposts of the video. The searches also showed results for many of the sites in China that are the final resting places for massive stacks of bicycles dumped by bike-sharing companies with failed business models. Perhaps the most striking video we found was titled, \"No Place To Place\u2014\u2014The Wonders of Shared Bicycle Graveyards in China.\"\nAt one point in our research, we stumbled upon an AFP video from 2021 that appeared to show the same yellow color and model of electric scooter bike. The caption for the clip said that it was captured \"outside the city of Shenyang.\" The end of the video showed a stadium with special colors for seating zones.\nAfter an exhaustive search, we were able to find this same stadium by using the map tools on the Chinese website Baidu.com. Unlike Google Maps, Baidu.com has street-level views of nearby roads. However, this part of our effort wasn't very helpful. It remained unclear if this was the same location where the viral clip was shot.\nFinally, a Lead\nIn the end, it was going back to TikTok that helped us find the origins of the video. A search on TikTok for \"electric share bike China\" brought us to this video from @evstevepan. The video showed the same kind of yellow electric scooter bike with a similar logo. A scan of the logo using a mobile phone camera and Google Translate revealed the company name Meituan, which is known as an \"all-encompassing platform for local services.\"\nThe logos appeared to be similar. (Courtesy: @smartsetting/@evstevepan on TikTok)\nWe then searched the internet for Meituan and electric scooters, which produced plenty of pictures on Shutterstock.com. For a moment, the two large characters on the side of the scooter didn't seem to match those from the viral video. We then horizontally flipped a still-frame from the viral video, which led us to discover that it had been mirrored, meaning that all words and numbers were backward.\nIt's blurry, but it's a match. \"App\" appears on the left, too. (Courtesy: @smartsetting/@evstevepan on TikTok)\nAll of these developme nts in our research led us to news articles that helped to show our findings were lining up.\nMeituan 'Walked Away' from Bike-Sharing\nIn April 2018, news broke that Meituan had purchased the company Mobike for $2.7 billion. According to the story, Mobike is \"a Chinese startup that helped pioneer bike-sharing services worldwide.\"\nBut by November of that same year, TechCrunch reported that Meituan would be \"[walking] away from bike-sharing and ride-hailing,\" as there wasn't enough demand from customers for the supply of its bike-sharing venture:\nIn April, Meituan entered the bike-sharing fray after it scooped up top player Mobike for $2.7 billion to face off Alibaba-backed Ofo. Over the past few years, Mobike and Ofo were burning through large sums of investor money in a bid to win users from subsidized rides, but both have shown signs of softening their stance recently.\nMobike is downsizing its fleets to \"avoid an oversupply\" as the bike-sharing market falters, Meituan's chief financial officer Chen Shaohui said during the earnings call. Ofo has also scaled back by closing down many of its international operations.\n...\nDuring its third quarter that ended September 30, Meituan posted a 97.2 percent jump on revenues to 19.1 billion yuan, or $2.75 billion, on the back of strong growth in food delivery transactions. The firm's investments in new initiatives \u2013 including ride-hailing and bike-sharing \u2013 took a toll as operating losses nearly tripled to 3.45 billion yuan compared to a year ago. Meituan shares plunged as much as 14 percent on Friday, the most since its spectacular listing.\nJust as so many electric bicycles from bike-sharing companies had piled up across China, so had electric scooters like the ones seen in the viral video.\nIn sum, social media users falsely claimed that a video showed tons of lined-up electric scooter bikes that were abandoned in a \"graveyard\" due to the high cost of EV battery replacement. All evidence pointed to a simple answer: supply and demand. The number of electric scooter bikes and bicycles far outnumbered the number of people who requested to use them (or else they went missing or were stolen), which resulted in downsizing by some companies, and the closure of others. The clip appears to have been shot in China, although its precise location is unclear.\nWe reached out to Meituan for comment on Nov. 29 but did not receive a response in time for publication.",

        "text": "No evidence that hundreds of electric mopeds were abandoned in China due to worn out batteries\nCountless electric mopeds are parked on a site, a video of which is circulating online. It is claimed that they were abandoned because their batteries stopped working. Switching or disposing of them is too expensive. However, according to the company that sells the e-mopeds, they are temporarily stored for other reasons.\n! [electromopeds-china battery-climate change-electric vehicles-tiktok] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elektromopeds-china-batterie-klimawandel-elektrofahrzeuge-tiktok-706x386.jpg 1x,\nhttps://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elektromopeds-china-batterie-klimawandel-elektrofahrzeuge-tiktok-1412x772.jpg 2x)\nHundreds of yellow-black electric mopeds are standing in a row on a large area. Some shrubs grow over abandoned vehicles. This is shown by a TikTok video circulating on Telegram with the claim: The electric scooters have been abandoned because they have reached the end of their battery life. Replacing the batteries is too expensive and disposing of them in any other way is even dangerous.\nThe Telegram post has over 60,000 views. On Facebook and Twitter (here and here), the claim is spreading hundreds of times, even internationally. A Polish Facebook post claims that the video is from France. The contributions are apparently intended to create a mood against electric vehicles. For example, one user commented on Facebook: \u201cThe same will happen with e-cars one day, there will be huge stockpiles and no one wants to dispose of the batteries. \u201d\nOur research shows: The video comes from China and shows e-mopeds in a parking lot rented by a rental company. There is no evidence that the vehicles are parked there due to non-functioning batteries \u2014 the company denies having given up the e-mopeds. Media reports suggest that there were simply too many e-mopeds in Chinese cities and authorities were asking providers to remove some of their vehicles.\n! [This Telegram post places a TikTok video in the wrong context. According to Meituan, the company that sells the electric mopeds, they are in storage on a site in southern China.] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tiktok-elektromopeds-china-batterie-klimawandel.png)\nThe yellow-black electric mopeds come from China\nA reverse image search with different still images from the TikTok video does not initially provide any clues as to the origin of the video. We therefore took a closer look at the TikTok channel \u201csmartsetting\u201d, on which the video was published on November 7, 2022. One user commented on the post: \u201cWhy are they there? What happened?\u201d Someone answered: \u201cThese are discarded rental bikes in China. \u201d\nA keyword search with \u201celectric scooter china\u201d brings us to another video on Tiktok from September 25, 2022, in which a user shows how much it costs to rent an electric moped in China. They are obviously the same models as the ones that can be seen hundreds of times in the first video: The logo, the colors, as well as the basket on the front and the seat match.\n! [A comparison with the video circulating on social networks (left) with another TikTok video (right) shows that these are electric mopeds from the Chinese company Meituan] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elektromopeds-china-batterie-klimawandel-eletrofahrzeuge-1.jpg)\nChinese company Meituan: Electric mopeds are temporarily parked in a rented outdoor parking lot\nTranslated, the logo \u201c\u201d on electric mopeds means \u201cMeituan\u201d. It is the name of a Chinese company that offers various services, such as food delivery or the rental of bicycles and e-mopeds. We've contacted the company.\nA Meituan spokesperson wrote to us: \u201cThe video shows one of the Meituan parking spaces for electronic mopeds in a southern Chinese city.\u201d The e-mopeds were not abandoned, but temporarily stored \u2014 on the one hand due to current weather conditions and on the other hand due to instructions from local authorities to reduce the number of mopeds in operation. The speaker did not want to answer our request as to where exactly the e-mopeds are stored.\nWe cannot verify why the e-mopeds are in the parking lot shown in the video, whether their batteries are still working or for what reasons they are not being recycled.\nMedia reports: Oversupply of electric mopeds\nHowever, Chinese media reports show that there were apparently actually too many e-mopeds in some cities; authorities took action against this. An article from February 9, 2021 on the web portal Sina.com is about the effects of oversupply: so-called cemeteries for e-\u2e3a- Bikes and e-mopeds. The two-wheeler sharing offers in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province in southeastern China, would have long exceeded the city's load limit. The article includes the black and yellow mopeds from Meituan.\nReports from January 2021 also show the Meituan mopeds (here and here). The articles give two reasons for the mass accumulation of electric mopeds: There were simply too many vehicles on the roads and some would not have had a license. Changsha City Council has asked six companies, including Meituan, to dispose of and recycle all unlicensed electric mopeds. According to Changsha traffic police, there were around 460,000 e-mopeds on the roads, of which only around 60,000 had a license.\nWe have already verified similar claims about electric vehicle \u201ccemeteries\u201d in the past (here and here). Other misleading statements that created sentiment included, for example, that electric cars would supposedly become worthless after eight years due to battery failure, or that e-cars would only save emissions compared to diesel cars after driving 219,000 kilometers or 14.6 years.\nEditorial: Victor Marinov, Alice Echtermann",

[No, New York City Government did not announce \u201cCO2 tracking\u201d of grocery purchases] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nein-New-Yorks-Stadtregierung-ku\u0308ndigte-kein-\u201eCO2-Tracking-von-Lebensmitteleinkaeufen-an-e1687184395223-706x386.jpg 1x,\nhttps://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nein-New-Yorks-Stadtregierung-ku\u0308ndigte-kein-\u201eCO2-Tracking-von-Lebensmitteleinkaeufen-an-e1687184395223-1412x772.jpg 2x)\nAccording to a video report by Austrian online broadcaster Auf1 on May 11, 2023, there will soon be a \u201cCO2 shopping control\u201d in New York, which uses credit card data to track residents' food purchases and thus measure their CO2 emissions. The New York City Government announced this in mid-April 2023.\nAs we have already reported, Auf1 is more likely to spread conspiracy stories and disinformation. The narrative about the alleged \u201cCO2 purchasing control\u201d in New York is also false; the city government did not announce it. Press spokesperson Rolf Rosenkranz from C40, a global network of major cities fighting climate change, confirmed to us that New York does not record household consumption. In addition, although the credit card provider American Express had supported the creation of consumption-based emission data, this was purely financial. There is no evaluation of individual consumption data and this is also not planned.\n! [Auf1 falsely claims that the City of New York wants to track population consumption using credit card information] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Auf1-Behauptung.jpg)\nNew York's city government did not speak of a \u201cCO2 purchasing control\u201d\nAuf1 bases its claims on an announcement from the City of New York in mid-April. At a press conference on April 17, 2023, the city government presented an emissions inventory that for the first time also includes CO2 emissions from consumer goods. The data show that nutrition is the third largest source of emissions after the building and transport sectors \u2014 meat and dairy products in particular have an unfavorable climate balance.\nAgainst this backdrop, New York Mayor Eric Adams announced that he wants to reduce food emissions by 33 percent by 2030. However, this only applies to municipal institutions, such as hospitals and schools. There was no talk of monitoring or even setting maximum values for individual consumption at any time in the press conference, nor was there any talk of collecting data on individual shopping behavior via credit cards.\nHow are New York's CO2 emissions measured?\nCO2 emissions are normally collected where they occur, i.e. where fossil fuels are burned or cows emit methane gas, for example. This is also referred to as direct emissions. Indirect emissions, on the other hand, relate to consumer goods \u2014 the emissions are not attributed to the production plant, but to the households that consume the product.\nData on direct greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 is available on the website of the City of New York. The indirect emissions caused by the consumption of goods have now been calculated for the first time in a separate emissions inventory. However, the data does not come from credit cards used by people in New York to buy their groceries, but is based on extrapolations of voluntary information provided by individual households. The extrapolation is based on data from 2019 to rule out deviations due to the corona pandemic.\nEcodataLab has compiled the emissions inventory for CO2 emissions and explains on its website: Indirect emissions are not measured through the consumption or behavior of individual households. \u201cInstead, we use a model (a series of complex calculations) to estimate consumption of goods and services and associated emissions,\u201d it says. The approach combines real consumption or emissions data, where available, and forecasts based on demographic, regional and national averages.\n! [email from Ben Gould, chairman of EcoDataLab] (https://correctiv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230619_Email_Ben_Gould-1.jpeg)\nWhen asked, Ben Gould, chairman of EcoDataLab, adds: The basis is data from the so-called \u201cUS Consumer Expenditures Survey,\u201d a nationwide survey in which selected households voluntarily provide information on their consumer behavior for a week. This data is Published anonymously by the \u201cUS Bureau of Labor Statistics.\u201d\nBased on this, it was calculated how certain factors \u2014 such as household size or household income \u2014 relate to consumer decisions. EcodataLab transferred these nationwide results to the local population in New York. According to Gould, these are therefore statistical calculations, not the tracking of individual consumption decisions. \u201cWe don't use credit card details,\u201d Gould wrote.\nData on consumption-based CO2 emissions is not based on data from credit card provider American Express\n\u201cThe city does not record household consumption,\u201d says Rolf Rosenkranz, spokesperson for C40, a network of almost a hundred major cities worldwide \u2014 including New York \u2014 which are working together to develop solutions to combat the climate crisis. C40 prepared the emissions inventory in collaboration with EcoDataLab and the City of New York.\nA C40 press release stated: The credit card provider American Express will support the preparation of a consumption-based emissions inventory. However, this meant financial support and not that data from owners of an American Express credit card should be used for recording consumption, as can be read in the emissions inventory published in 2023. Rosenkranz also confirms: \u201cAmerican Express did not provide any credit card details [...] and does not plan to do so.\u201d The credit card provider only supported C40 financially.\nWe also checked with the City of New York and American Express, but received no response until the fact check was published. In addition to the press conference in April, the New York City website with the search terms \u201cCO2\u201d and \u201ccredit card\u201d does not contain any other references to plans to set maximum levels of food consumption or to record data using credit card data. We also did not find any information about this on the American Express website.\nIn connection with the City of New York's CO2 reduction plans, there was another false claim about restricting individual food consumption, which we have reviewed here.\nEditorial: Kimberly Nicolaus, Uschi Jonas\nThe most important public sources for this fact check:\n- Press conference with New York Mayor Eric Adams, April 17, 2023: link (English, archived)\n- Transcript of the press conference with New York Mayor Eric Adams, April 17, 2023: link (English, archived)\n- Direct and indirect emissions, Federal Statistical Office Destatis, 2023: Link\n- NYC Greenhouse Gas Inventories with data from 2005: link (English)\n- New York City Household Consumption-Based Emissions Inventory, 2023: link (English, archived)\n- Press release from C40, May 9, 2022: link (English, archived)",

        "text": "In June 2020, an old episode of the reality courtroom show \"Judge Judy\" started to circulate online along with the claim that the plaintiff in the case was George Floyd, a Black man whose death while in policy custody in May 2020 sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice:\nPostings of this video were frequently followed by derogatory comments about Floyd and the insinuation that his past deeds, such as (allegedly) the carjacking discussed in the video above, either justified his untimely death at the hands of a police officer or made him unworthy to be the centerpiece of nationwide protests.\nBut the man named George Floyd in the above-displayed video is not the George Floyd who died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nFor starters, the person in the \"Judge Judy\" video is identified as \"George Floyd IV,\" while the full name of the man who died in May 2020 was \"George Perry Floyd Jr.\"\nSecond, the above-displayed episode of \"Judge Judy\" aired in 2010 and shows a 17-year-old who had been arrested in Chicago. That would make the \"Judge Judy\" George Floyd about 27 years old at the time of this writing. The George Floyd who sparked police brutality protests died on May 25, 2020, at the age of 46.\nWe confirmed with CBS that this episode aired in 2010. Furthermore, we found a December 2009 news article that appears to be about the same carjacking incident, and a 2010 law blog post about Judge Judy that also mentioned this carjacking episode.\nIn December 2009, NBC Chicago reported that a 17-year-old was arrested after he crashed a hijacked car. The Floyd in this article appears to be the same Floyd in the \"Judge Judy\" video. For example, in both instances, this person said that they stole the car because they were cold while walking home:\nA teen was ordered held on $250,000 bond Monday for allegedly carjacking and punching an off-duty Chicago Police officer Sunday night in the South Chicago neighborhood on the Southeast Side. He reportedly told police he did it because he was cold.\nGeorge Floyd, 17, of the 8200 block of South Marquette Avenue, is charged with vehicular hijacking, aggravated battery to a peace officer and aggravated fleeing, according to police. All the charges are felonies.\n[...]\nFloyd allegedly told police, \u201cI was walking home and I was very cold. I didn\u2019t want to walk home,\u2019\u2019 the officer said.\nThe website Legal As She Is Spoke also wrote about this episode in September 2010:\nEven those unfamiliar with her show got to witness Her Honor in action when, in a clip shown to the audience, Judge Judy issued a ruling in a carjacking case in which a 16-year-old defendant threw a woman from her car and drove off. His excuse? He \u201cwas cold,\u201d he said, expressing little remorse for his actions, Judge Judy spoke directly to the teen\u2019s father who looked as if he\u2019d given up on taking responsibility for his son. She also addressed the defendant\u2019s previous infractions and sentenced the minor to additional hours working for his father, thereby preventing him from concentrating on his \u201cpersonal life\u201d to which he attributed his poor work ethic.\nThe above-displayed video shows a person named \"George Floyd IV\" on an episode of \"Judge Judy.\" But this is not the same George Floyd who died while in police custody in May 2020.

        "text": "Contrary to a recent bit of fake news that has been spreading around lately, George Floyd did not appear on the Judge Judy show when he was a young man.\nIn recent weeks, people have been spreading a misleading video online that claims to show Floyd in Judy Sheindlin\u2019s court room, facing charges for stealing and damaging a car. National Review has noted that the episode was shot 10 years ago, so if Floyd was 17 years old back then, he must\u2019ve been around 27 when he died at the hands of the Minneapolis police two months ago.\nThe problem, however, is this is a completely different George Floyd.\nThe man on Judge Judy is identified as George Floyd IV, but as for the man whose death sparked national outrage against racial injustice, his full name was George Perry Floyd, Jr. Floyd Jr. was 46 years old at the time of his death, and if the age discrepancy wasn\u2019t enough, Reuters did a photo comparison and found that the two Floyds do not resemble each other.\nJudging by the manner in which the Judge Judy video was spread around, it appears that this is a public effort to falsely portray George Perry Floyd, Jr. in a negative light as America continues to observe protests against police brutality. Ever since these demonstrations took off, critics have made attacks on Floyd\u2019s character in order to delegitimize the protests carried out in his name.\nWatch above.",

        "description": "President Donald Trump is making law and order a central element in his campaign.",
        "text": "WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN PORTLAND?\nProtests over the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis have taken place in downtown Portland for more than 50 consecutive days, drawing at times more than 10,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators.\nA relatively small number of activists have vandalised downtown buildings, including the federal courthouse, and attacked police and federal agents.\nTrump issued an executive order on June 26 to protect monuments and federal property after protesters tried to remove or destroy statues of people considered racist, including a failed attempt to pull down one of Andrew Jackson near the White House.\nThe Department of Homeland Security dispatched agents to Portland as well as Seattle and Washington, D.C., starting around the Fourth of July weekend.\nWHY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY?\nDHS, which was formed after the September 11, 2001, attacks to improve the nation's response to the threat of international terrorism, oversees some of the largest US law enforcement agencies.\nThat includes the Border Patrol as well as Immigration Customs and Enforcement, which are seeing less of their usual activity because of Covid-19.\nDHS also oversees the Federal Protective Service, which guards federal buildings along with the US Marshals Service.\nDHS sent members of the Border Patrol, along with Secret Service officers, Air Marshals and others, to Portland to protect the downtown courthouse complex.\nWHAT HAPPENED AFTER FEDERAL FORCES ARRIVED?\nFederal officers and protesters clashed in the streets outside the federal courthouse.\nDemonstrators broke windows and did other damage, hurled rocks at the officers and shined lasers in their eyes. Agents have fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators and arrested about 43 people since July 4, mostly for minor offenses.\nTensions escalated after an officer with the Marshals Service fired a less-lethal round at a protester's head on July 11, critically injuring him.\nThey ratcheted up further when agents in unmarked vehicles with generic \"police\" patches on their camouflage uniforms arrested people at night without identifying themselves.\nDHS officials defended the arrests today, saying they were carried out lawfully and intended to protect officers from violent crowds.\nThey also noted it is routine to use unmarked vehicles. But it seemed to many like the US had created a secret police force, and it drew lawsuits as well as more protesters into the streets.\nIS IT LEGAL FOR FEDERAL FORCES TO BE USED LIKE THIS?\nYes, to a certain extent. Federal authorities can enforce federal laws on federal property, like the courthouse in downtown Portland.\nBut state and local officials say the federal agents have operated beyond their jurisdiction, and that has raised constitutional issues now being challenged in court.\nAs Michael Dorf, a professional of constitutional law at Cornell University, told AP: \"The idea that there's a threat to a federal courthouse and the federal authorities are going to swoop in and do whatever they want to do without any cooperation and coordination with state and local authorities is extraordinary outside the context of a civil war.\"\nEVEN IF IT'S LEGAL, IS IT A GOOD IDEA?\nDHS has assisted with local enforcement before, but not without consent.\nIt sent agents to Puerto Rico to help confront a spike in crime linked to drug trafficking in 2013 and dispatched the Border Patrol's tactical team to track two escaped convicts in rural upstate New York in 2015. But as John Cohen, a former senior DHS official under Obama and President George W. Bush, noted, those were conducted in close cooperation with state and local authorities.\nEmploying DHS on its own, in a mission that seems to be suspiciously aligned with the President's re-election campaign, appears to be unprecedented.\n\"If the public begins to perceive that they are being partisan in how they operate they lose credibility, and if they lose credibility, they lose public trust,\" said Cohen, who now teaches at Georgetown University.\nWHAT CAN BE EXPECTED TO HAPPEN NEXT?\nThe Oregon attorney-general filed a lawsuit arguing that the federal government had violated the rights of citizens of the state by detaining people without probable cause.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has also sued, seeking to stop the federal government's use of rubber bullets, tear gas and acoustic weapons against journalists and other legal observers. These and other legal actions could force the federal agents to change tactics or perhaps downsize their mission in the city.\nActing DHS Secretary Chad Wolf at a news conference urged state and local authorities in Portland to work with the federal government to stop the violence directed at federal personnel and property.\nHe also sought to draw a sharp distinction between people demonstrating against police brutality and those attacking the courthouse. \"If you're looking to peacefully protest in Portland, the department respects your right to do so,\" he said.\nTrump ha s praised the DHS response and criticised local officials for letting a situation get \"out of control.\"\nAn official told AP that Homeland Security was planning to deploy about 150 agents to Chicago for at least two months in a mission expected to focus on gun crime, not the protection of federal property.\nTrump, who sees the use of federal officers as a way to embarrass Democratic local officials, wants them used in other cities. \"We're going to have more federal law enforcement, that I can tell you,\" Trump said.\n- AP",

        "text": "\"I mean, that he can pick on our city mostly because of the way we vote and make an example of it for his base is very frightening,\" she said.\nFar from tamping down the unrest, the presence of federal agents on the streets of Portland \u2014 and particularly allegations they have whisked people away in unmarked cars without probable cause \u2014 has given new momentum and a renewed, laser-sharp focus to protests that had begun to devolve into smaller, chaotic crowds.\nThe use of federal agents against the will of local officials has also set up the potential for a constitutional crisis \u2014 and one that could escalate if Trump sends federal agents elsewhere, as he says he plans to do.\nFederal forces were deployed to Portland in early July, and tensions have grown since then: first, on July 11, when a protester was hospitalised with critical injuries after a US Marshals Service officer struck him in the head with a round of what's known as less-lethal ammunition.\nThen, anger flared again over the weekend after video surfaced of a federal agent hitting a US Navy veteran repeatedly with a baton while another agent sprays him in the face with pepper spray.\nCrowds had recently numbered fewer than 100 people but swelled to more than 1000 over the weekend \u2014 and they are once again attracting a broader base in a city that's increasingly unified and outraged.\nFederal agents again used force to scatter protesters and deployed tear gas and rubber bullets as some in the crowd banged on the doors of the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse and attempted to pull plywood off the closed entryway.\nThe Portland Police Bureau said in a statement that some protesters lit fires in the street and tried several times to light fires at the courthouse doors.\n\"It is time for the Trump troops to go home and focus their attention on other activities,\" Oregon Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, said on MSNBC.\nIn a news conference in Washington, acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf defended the agency's response in Portland, saying it has clear authority to protect government property and detain people suspected of threatening personnel or damaging such property.\nHe disputes that unidentified agents have arrested people, noting they have the word \"police\" on their uniforms. He said agents have been assaulted with lasers, bats, fireworks, bottles and other weapons and \"yet the city of Portland takes little to no action.\"\nWolf said the people committing the vandalism should not be considered legitimate protesters. He said DHS officers wear camouflage, as they do when they work on the border.\n\"These police officers are not storm troopers, they are not Gestapo. That description is offensive,\" Wolf said.\nBut constitutional law experts said federal officers' actions are \"unprecedented\" and a \"red flag\" in what could become a test case of states' rights as the Trump administration expands federal policing.\nElsewhere, the Department of Homeland Security said yesterday that it plans to deploy about 150 of its agents to Chicago to help local law enforcement deal with a spike in crime, according to an official with direct knowledge of the plans.\nThe Trump Administration also sent more than 100 federal law enforcement officers to Kansas City to help quell a rise in violence after the shooting death of a young boy there.\nFor days after the death of George Floyd \u2014 a Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck \u2014 protests against police brutality and racial injustice in Portland attracted thousands and were largely peaceful.\nBut smaller groups of up to several hundred people have vandalised federal property and local law enforcement buildings, at times setting fires to police precincts and smashing windows. They have also clashed violently with local police.\nA constant focus of protesters has been the federal courthouse, which sits in the heart of downtown and is now covered with graffiti and completely boarded up, with only thin slits cut into the plywood for federal agents to use as peepholes.\nPortland police used tear gas on multiple occasions until a federal court order banned its officers from doing so without declaring a riot. Now, anger is building as federal officers deploy tear gas.\nState and local authorities, who didn't ask for federal help, are awaiting a decision in a state lawsuit that seeks to restrain the federal agents' actions.\nState Attorney-General Ellen Rosenblum said in court papers that masked federal agents have arrested people on the street, far from the courthouse, with no probable cause and whisked them away in unmarked cars.\nThe federal government faces also another lawsuit, filed today in federal court. In it, the Western States Centre, two state representatives and others argue federal agents violated protesters' 10th Amendment rights because they engaged in police activities that are designated to local and state governments. The Western States Centre, based in Portland, he lps organize and promote the rights of minority and low-income communities.\nOfficials in Illinois and Chicago have also pushed back on the planned deployment there. Governor J.B. Pritzker called it a \"wrongheaded move.\"\nAs crowds have swelled again in Portland, most prominent among them now are the Wall of Mums and PDX Dad Pod, self-described parents who have shown up each night since the weekend by the hundreds, wearing yellow T-shirts and bicycle helmets and ski goggles for protection and carrying sunflowers.\nSome wielded leaf blowers to help disperse tear gas as they marched down a major downtown street and joined up with several hundred Black Lives Matter protesters in front of the federal courthouse.\n\"It's appalling to me, and it's a unifying thing. Nobody wants them here,\" said Eryn Hoerster, a mother of two children, ages 4 and 8, who was attending her first nighttime protest.\n- AP",

        "text": "![](https://www.boomlive.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/rohingya-children-story-featured-image.jpg)\nAs the anti-Rohingya rhetoric on social media in India grows, fake narratives are being spun around photographs of children as part of a divisive propaganda.\nThis is likely to get worse in the coming days as India woke up to news that Myanmar's army had discovered a mass grave of 28 Hindus in Rakhine. The Burmese army has blamed Muslim Rohingya militants for the killings. (Read - Mass grave of 28 Hindus found in Myanmar: army)\nBOOM came across two instances in the last 24 hours where fake stories were weaved around actual photos of children. The reactions and comments on these posts show that they have been extremely effective in stirring religious bigotry.\nRavinder Sangwan, who goes by the Twitter handle @Shanknaad and who is followed by Railways Minister Piyush Goyal, tweeted the below image of a little girl holding an infant. The image appears to be a screenshot from a BBC News video\nSangwan claimed that the girl was 14 years old and had two children. He also claimed she was married to a 56-year old man who had six wives and 18 children.\nBut Sangwan's story is a figment of imagination. BOOM traced the screenshot to BBC News' video - 'In the jungle with Rohingya refugees feeling Myanmar ' uploaded on YouTube on September 4th.\nIn the video, BBC's correspondent Sanjoy Majumder is seen trekking alongside people fleeing Myanmar. The girl in the image can be seen at 2 minutes and 06 seconds. The girl is not mentioned in the clip proving that the backstory given to her by social media is fake.\nScreenshot of BBC New's video\nWe found the exact same fabricated story on a right-wing Facebook page called 'India Rising'.\nAs India's Supreme Court hears a petition challenging the government's decision to deport 40,000 Rohingyas living illegally in India, some nationalists are leaving nothing to chance and are turning out a near constant drip of vitriol.\nAdvocate Prashant P. Umrao tried to pass off the image of a sick child in Brazil as that of a pregnant Rohingya refugee girl at a UN clinic.\n![](https://www.boomlive.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ippatel.jpg)\nOnce again, his story turned out to be fake. Umrao subsequently deleted his tweet when called out by BOOM on Twitter.\nBOOM found a Facebook post going back to November 2016 which contained several photos of the girl. The post in Portuguese states that Sandy Brand\u00e3o da Cruz, 12, a resident of the city of Garraf\u00e3o do Norte, Par\u00e1 (Brazil) was hospitalized at the Barros Barreto Hospital in Bel\u00e9m. She was suffering from a problems of the liver and spleen.\nA video where Sandy speaks in Portuguese about wanting to meet Brazilian actor, singer, dancer and TV presenter Rodrigo Faro proves that the child has no connection to Myanmar.\nIt's not just Hindu or Buddhists nationalists who are guilty of using fake images online to rally support.\nThe fresh outbreak of violence in Rakhine since August 25th has sparked a steady stream of inflammatory but nevertheless fake images from both sides that are muddying public opinion about the conflict.\n(Also Read: Rohingya Crisis: Fake Images Are Sowing Distrust And Fueling Bigotry On Both Sides)",

His posts on social media are communal in nature and although he merely claims to be a \u201clay person interested in politics\u201d, his posts betray a right-wing Hindu nationalist mindset.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-5.jpg)\nIn fact, following the disqualification of Aam Aadmi Party MLAs by the Election Commission, Umrao was feted by prominent Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, hailing him as a crusader for righteousness.\n.@ippatel, the lawyer who led the crusade against 20 AAP MLAs in the #OfficeOfProfit case met me today as he is concerned about his safety & security. I will speak to Home Minister to ensure his well-being. I firmly believe there should be zero tolerance for violence in politics. pic.twitter.com/AH5MucAGA5\u2014 Vijay Goel (@VijayGoelBJP) January 22, 2018\nHeartiest Congratulations @ippatel Keep serving the nation. India First Hinduism Best. Vandematram, Bharat Mata Ki Jai\u2014 Ashwini Upadhyay (@AshwiniBJP) January 19, 2018\nAlt News has documented many of Umrao\u2019s doings on social media.\nSpreading fake and misleading news\n1. In October 2017, in a shocking incident, a Swiss tourist couple was physically assaulted at Fatehpur Sikri in Uttar Pradesh. The couple sustained grievous injuries and the report made international news. Prashant Umrao was among those who spread the fake information that members of the minority community had attacked the Swiss couple.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-10.jpg)\nLater it emerged that the assaulters were not from the minority community. The detailed report was published by Alt News and can be read here.\n2. When it was reported that Vikas Barala, son of the President of Haryana BJP had allegedly stalked a girl in Chandigarh, following which a police complaint had been filed, Prashant Umrao was among those who went on an overdrive to shame the victim. He indulged in character assassination, posting an old photograph of the victim.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-12.jpg)\nThe male in the picture is not the accused Vikas Barala as was claimed and circulated by sections of right-wing twitterati. However this did not prevent Umrao from sharing such blatantly false and misleading information about the victim.\n3. When the Utkal Express derailed at Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh in August 2017, Umrao was among those who spread rumours of conspiracy and sabotage. He alleged that the accident was actually a \u201cterror ploy\u201d and claimed that clips of rail-road had been removed. He added that it could be a move to kill Hindu pilgrims.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-14.jpg)\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-15.jpg)\nThere was no terror angle to the accident. A preliminary assessment had suggested human error to be the cause of the accident. However that did not deter rumour mongers like Umrao.\n4. Prashant Umrao was among those who spread the news that journalist Ravish Kumar\u2019s sister had been suspended from government service on charges of corruption.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-17.jpg)\nIt turned out that the woman who had been named was not the sister of Ravish Kumar. In fact, she was not related to the journalist at all. Despite this, the rumour was made viral by right-wing twitter users, since Ravish Kumar is hugely unpopular with sympathisers and supporters of the ruling party and the BJP-led government.\n5. Umrao posted the following on Twitter, calling it a photograph of a \u201c9-12 yr pregnant girl.. from Rohingya refugee camp in Rakhine state, Myanmar\u201d. \u201cShe is in UN clinic, giving birth to a child soon,\u201d he had added.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-19.jpg)\nT he fake news was called out almost immediately after he had posted it. The photograph is actually of a Brazilian girl from Garraf\u00e3o do Norte, who was suffering from liver disease. Umrao quietly deleted his tweet without an apology.\nDespite being caught repeatedly for lying, what has been presented so far will seem benign in comparison to what Umrao regularly posts on social media. Umrao was a member of the Facebook group \u201cHindu Defence League\u201d. He was also a member of the Hindu Sena who became famous for celebrating U.S President Donald Trump\u2019s birthday, heralding him as the \u201csaviour of humanity\u201d. His posts and messages are replete with violence and gore, openly calling for bloodshed and using some of the vilest language to describe minorities and women.\nRants against religious minorities\nUmrao\u2019s pathological hatred for Muslims is on full display on social media. In the following tweet, he brazenly calls for slaying each and every Muslim to pieces.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-21.jpg)\nRough translation: \u201cEach and every Muslim has to be butchered. Every mosque has to be destroyed. Akhilesh, stop us if you can. All brave Hindu of the country are called upon to proceed to Muzaffarnagar.\u201d\nThis tweet was in the aftermath of the communal violence that rocked the Muzaffarnagar region in 2013.\nIn another tweet, he lamented the role of the police, and said they were oppressing Hindus instead of preventing their slaughter by Muslims.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-23.jpg)\nIn another tweet of March 2014, he reminded people of the violence unleashed in Muzaffarnagar and Godhra, saying \u201cImran Masud, we will finish what you begin, just like Godhra. Then keep shouting for 10 years, like Gujarat. Do you remember Muzaffarnagar?\u201d:\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-25.jpg)\nIn yet another tweet of 2014, he used a derogatory reference for Muslims and said he wished to see them butchered.\nAll Half Dicks are good in Killing and Slaughtering.\u2014 Prashant P. Umrao (@ippatel) February 18, 2014\nI wish to see those sub human butchered like this.#MyJihad#HDL pic.twitter.com/IbfAc727Al\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-28.jpg)\nNot only Muslims, Umrao has also targeted the Sikh community through his tweets.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-30.jpg)\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-31.jpg)\nLove for Godse and Hitler\nUmrao\u2019s attitude and beliefs are unsurprising, considering that he venerates and eulogises Nathuram Godse, the murderer of Mahatma Gandhi.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-33.jpg)\nHe is also a big fan of German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, praising and defending him on social media.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-35.jpg)\nHatred for women\nUmrao is rather unabashed about his misogynistic instincts and tendencies. On a number of occasions, he has posted provocative and outrageous tweets and messages, derogatorily referring to women, reducing them to body parts and using vituperative language.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-37.jpg)\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-38.jpg)\nIn the tweet above he targets Shah Rukh Khan and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee with an outrageous comment. Umrao reiterated his despicable attitude with regard to the West Bengal chief minister in another instance.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-40.jpg)\nUmrao consistently targets celebrities through his tweets and often resorts to abusive language.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-42.jpg)\nHate for seculars\nUmrao displays profound hatred and disdain for those who consider and call themselves \u201csecular\u201d. Sample his tweets below. He targets director Mahesh Bhatt who has often voiced opinions unpalatable to the establishment.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-44.jpg)\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-45.jpg)\nUmrao\u2019s language is toxic but his lack of conviction with regard to what he believes is unable to stay hidden. After his controversial tweets started drawing attention, he went about deleting them quietly.\n![](https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/867823-47.jpg)\nPrashant Umrao is representative of the hardened elements of the Hindutva ecosystem. He makes use of his new-found popularity to spread messages of hate and violence against minorities and women with impunity. His posts are an open incitement to bloodshed. He also regularly posts fake and misleading information. Despite the obvious bigotry on display, people like Umrao thrive on social media and are promoted by politicians. They have a loyal following of similar-minded persons who are more than eager to lap up the hate, spreading its tentacles further. There is an urgent need to take action against him and all those who are openly flouting  the law and irreparably rupturing the social fabric in the process.\nThis article first appeared on Alt news.",

Must feel like the MCG in 1992 for Imran Khan\u201d.\nUrduPoint, a website based in Pakistan, also published the image in April 2018.\nReuters images of the April 21, 2022 Lahore rally in support of Khan can be viewed (here).\nImran Khan also released a video of the gathering on his Facebook page.\nPakistan\u2019s lower house of parliament voted on April 10 to remove Khan from office, following a nearly 14-hour standoff between the opposition and Khan\u2019s ruling PTI party.\nKhan has since demanded fresh elections amid political turmoil after a new government took over and warned it faces an enormous challenge to revive a battered economy.\nReuters previously addressed another miscaptioned image of a dense crowd gathered late in the day that was shared online with the false claim that it showed an April 13, 2022 rally in support of Khan.

Junaid Akbar also praised Ali Amin Gandapur, stating that he took charge of the party at a time when no one else was willing to do so. He added that no financial request would be made to Ali Amin Gandapur for the rally\u2019s expenses.\nJunaid Akbar said that each village council must arrange transportation and mobilisation of workers at its own level for PTI\u2019s February 8 rally.",

Commuters are advised to plan alternate routes as authorities are enforcing strict security protocols, further exacerbating the traffic situation.\nMinar-e-Pakistan Sealed Off\nAll six entry gates to Minar-e-Pakistan are locked by authorities, following directives from the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA). Containers have also been placed within the monument\u2019s grounds to prevent access, leaving tourists and locals barred from visiting the historic site.\nPTI leadership has instructed workers to remain peaceful and avoid confrontations with law enforcement. They have also outlined a flexible strategy to hold rallies at alternate locations if entry to Minar-e-Pakistan is denied.

A clearer version of the screenshot viewable on C-SPAN of the livestream of her testimony shows Taylor Greene flicking her hair, and not adjusting a wire or earpiece.\nTaylor Greene was testifying in a Georgia state court in Atlanta in a novel legal challenge to her candidacy accusing her of violating a U.S. Constitution provision called the \"Insurrectionist Disqualification Clause\" by supporting an incendiary rally that preceded last year\u2019s attack on the U.S. Capitol ( here ).\nUsers subsequently shared an image online of Greene during the testimony with claims that the representative was wearing a hearing device.\nOne user shared the image on Twitter with text that reads: \u201cThe tweet pointing this out has retweets disabled, so I copied the pic bc people should see. Earpiece at her armpit, got suck [sic] in her hair. See?\u201d ( here ).\nThe tweet had over 5,600 likes and 3,400 shares at the time of writing.\nThe image circulating online is heavily filtered and does not show the Republican representative wearing a wire device. Instead, a clearer version of the screenshot as seen on the livestream of the testimony shows Taylor Greene fixing her hair ( here ).\nThe filter on the image circulating online makes it appear as if a thick strand of Greene\u2019s hair is a type of earpiece.\nThe clip is also viewable on C-SPAN, Part 4 of her testimony at the administrative hearing [at 1:15:08] where Greene is seen fixing her hair, not flicking aside a wire ( here ).\nA spokesperson for Greene, Nick Dyer, also told Reuters that the image does not show Greene wearing an earpiece.\nOn April 18, 2022, a federal judge ruled that a lawsuit seeking to block Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene from seeking reelection, alleging she is unfit for office because of her support of rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol, can proceed.\nReuters previously addressed the baseless claim circulating shortly after the 2020 U.S. presidential debates in September 2020 that the Democrat contender and current president Joe Biden was wearing a wire ( here ).The image circulating online at the time likely showed a crease in Biden\u2019s shirt.\nVERDICT\nAltered. A filtered image circulating online does not show the U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene wearing an earpiece. A clearer version of the screenshot viewable on a C-SPAN livestream of Greene\u2019s testimony in a Georgia state court on April 22, 2022, shows the Republican fixing her hair, not shifting an earpiece.",

Some online users had claimed that White House spokesperson Jen Psaki had announced plans to reform the law shortly after the news billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk had reached an agreement to buy the social media platform, Twitter.\nAnother commented on Facebook: \u201cBREAKING NEWS: Now that Musk will own Twitter, the White House is concerned about reforming Section 230. Imagine that?????\u201d (here).\nOther social media posts claiming Section 230 reforms are urgently in focus can be seen (here), (here) and (here).\n\u2014 George (@BehizyTweets) April 25, 2022\nThe press secretary made no announcements in relation to Section 230 during the April 25, 2022 briefing. Reforming Section 230 has been a longstanding aim of President Biden, a spokesperson for the White House told Reuters.\nSection 230 was explicitly mentioned twice during Monday\u2019s briefing in response to questions posed by reporters. The full transcript of the briefing can be found (here) while a livestream of the briefing can be viewed (bit.ly/3LlMeTI).\nA reporter asked Psaki: \u201cAnd just a quick one on the breaking news: Twitter agreeing to let Elon Musk purchase \u2014 make his \u2014 go through with this purchase. Do you have a response to that? And does the White House have any concern that this new agreement might have President Trump back on the platform?\u201d\nIn response, Psaki said: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to comment on a specific transaction ... [Biden] has been a strong supporter of fundamental reforms to achieve that goal, including reforms to Section 230, enacting antitrust reforms, requiring more transparency, and more. And he\u2019s encouraged that there\u2019s bipartisan interest in Congress\u201d.\nAnother reporter asked: \u201cI\u2019m wondering: Regardless of ownership, would the White House be interested in working with Twitter like it has in the past to continue to combat this kind of misinformation? Or are we in a different part of the pandemic where that kind of partnership is no longer necessary?\u201d\nPsaki answered: \u201cWell, I think we engage regularly with all social media platforms about steps that can be taken that has continued, and I\u2019m sure it will continue. But there are also reforms that we think Congress could take and we would support taking, including reforming Section 230, enacting antitrust reforms, requiring more transparency. And the president is encouraged by the bipartisan support for \u2014 or engagement in those efforts\u201d.\nPresident Biden has previously spoken in support of reforming Section 230, so to present this as a sudden policy decision would be misleading.\nIn an interview with The New York Times editorial board in January 2020, shortly after his victory in the 2020 presidential elections, Biden voiced his view that the law should be revoked immediately.\nIn an October 2021 briefing, a reporter asked Psaki: \u201cThanks, Jen. Yesterday\u2019s hearing by a Facebook whistleblower underscored several major issues with the company, including, as many senators pointed out, issues with Section 230. On the campaign trail, Biden said that Section 230 should, quote, \"immediately be revoked\" and that it should be revoked because, quote, Facebook \"is not just an Internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false.\" Does the White House stand by that assessment for Section 230, given the revelations now?\u201d\nPsaki responded: \u201cWell, the President has long said, as you referenced, that tech platforms must be held accountable for the harms that they cause. And he has been a strong supporter of fundamental reforms to achieve that goal. This includes Section 230 reforms. It also includes privacy and antitrust reforms as well as more transparency\u201d.\nIn a November 2021 press briefing, Psaki reaffirmed President Biden\u2019s position on Section 230.\nA reporter posed a question on whether Biden supports revoking the law after the Justice Department defended Section 230 in a lawsuit filed by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Psaki responded: \u201c[Biden] called for reforms of Section 230; that continues to be his position\u201d.\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump also expression an intention to revoke Section 230 when he was in office.\nSection 230 was a central talking point during the October 2020 tech hearing, where Democrats and Republicans quizzed \u2018Big Tech\u2019 CEOs on policies.\nLawmakers have been split on ways to hold Big Tech accountable under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - which protects companies from liability over content  posted by users but also lets the firms shape political discourse.\nRepublican lawmakers used most of their time during the hearing to accuse the companies of selective censorship against conservatives. Democrats primarily focused on insufficient action against misinformation that interferes with the election.\nIn response to several questions discussing the law, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google said Section 230 was crucial to free expression on the internet. They said the law gives them the tools to strike a balance between preserving free speech and moderating content, even as they appeared open to suggestions the law needs moderate changes.\nVERDICT\nMissing context. The White House did not make any new announcements pertaining to Section 230, a law that shields online companies from liability over content posted by users, following Elon Musk\u2019s agreement with Twitter to buy the platform. Press Secretary Jen Psaki responded to press questions on the topic on Monday. President Biden repeatedly expressed support for reforming the law prior to Musk\u2019s agreement with Twitter.",

It reads: \u201cCongratulations @ElonMusk and @SpaceX on the successful #FalconHeavy launch. This achievement, along with @NASA\u2019s commercial and international partners, continues to show American ingenuity at its best!\u201d\nAt the time, Musk, chief executive of the aerospace company SpaceX, replied, saying: \u201cThank you on behalf of SpaceX. An exciting future lies ahead!\u201d (see here ).\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 7, 2018\nHowever, the fabricated screenshot (which is likely to have been edited from the original exchange as the date and minute timestamps match), appears to show Musk replying: \u201cI\u2019m from South Africa you dumbass.\u201d See example here ( here ).\nReuters found no evidence of Musk ever tweeting this. An advanced search on his Twitter feed brought no relevant results ( bit.ly/3Lm6btN ).\nWhile the fabricated screenshot has been online since at least Feb. 10, 2018 ( here) (here ) and debunked since by Snopes ( here ), the content has resurfaced after the news broke of Musk\u2019s Twitter deal on April 25, 2022.\nAn iteration posted on Twitter has been retweeted more than 2,400 times since it was posted on April 25 archived here ( here ).\nApril 26, 2022\n\u201cPeople worrying that Elon Musk will support Trump on Twitter easily forget their dialogue on the platform,\u201d a Facebook user commented (here ).\nMusk, born in Pretoria, South Africa, clinched a deal to buy Twitter Inc for $44 billion cash on April 25 in a transaction that will shift control of the social media platform populated by millions of users and global leaders to the world\u2019s richest person ( here ).\nVERDICT\nFalse. This screenshot allegedly showing Elon Musk calling former U.S. President Donald Trump a \u201cdumbass\u201d is fabricated.",
